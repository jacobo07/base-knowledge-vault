I've helped creators make over $22 million in GMV and over $3 million in personal profit. >> You've helped people generate over $22 million on Tik Tok shop. >> Over 22 million, dude. >> What's the number one thing that you feel like people need to change when they're doing Tik Tok? >> 100%. It's going to be >> Welcome back to the number one social commerce podcast on the internet. Today we are joined by my boy Nick Fowler. Nick has been in the Tik Tok shop space

since the beginning of the affiliate program. Nick has killed it for himself as also with his entire family. His sister's done over 10 million in sales and he's helped coach so many students to becoming successful. Nick, what do you do for a living? >> Tik Tok shop, man. >> Tik Tok shop. I absolutely love it. So, listen, bro. Like when I like what I was saying is like when I started this podcast, it was very much so like structured and like what do you do? How do you make money? Um, I feel like this

one's going to be interesting because you're not just a shop creator. You're this new version of things that we are becoming, which is like a social commerce influencer, >> I believe. Yeah, there's a couple of us. Yeah, there's like Yeah, there's a good amount, but it's I honestly think it's going to continue to grow in that regard, but yeah, I'm I'm definitely moving in the direction of I'm I'm trying to build something longterm. And the scary part about Tik Tok Shop

affiliate is that it could all be gone tomorrow. I talked about this with my sister or you know, like your account could be gone tomorrow. You got to like restart this thing or that thing, right? And um again, it's super lucrative. The money is there, right? Like that's where all the money is at. But I I want something I could build long term. So, I'm building my personal brand like crazy right now. But you personally like when you started cuz you've done how many in how much in sales?

>> I've done three million in GMBB just myself. Um but obviously my story is that like my whole family's in this whole thing. So that's definitely a huge part of it too. But >> and then like what's been your highest day in sales that you've had? >> Highest day I actually don't even know exactly. I probably have a screenshot somewhere, but it's I probably 50 plus in sales >> in one day. Yeah. >> What was your best product of all time? >> Retractable car charger. I actually just

posted a video about this recently. Yeah. That thing was only at 50 sales when I promoted it and now it's at over $200,000 sales and I was the first one to make it go viral. So, I think it was at like $850 in total GMV for that one product ever. And then I now it's at like $4 million in GMV because I I took it off first and then everyone flooded to it cuz I was posting about I was like, "Hey, this video like went super viral and like everybody hopped on it." >> I remember when that was going viral.

That was like what two years ago maybe at this point >> just about. Yeah. >> So, you you were one of the first people that I ever saw talking about Tik Tok shop. I'm not gonna lie. I think I I joined your community. Really? >> I watched the videos and I left. >> So [laughter] funny. >> Don't do that. >> No. Yeah. I mean, there's value. A lot of people do. >> Um, >> but at that time, I was just so hungry to learn what Tik Tock shop was >> and so, um, you were one of the faces

that really was talking about Tik Tok at the time and educating people the right way to do it. >> Um, because it's so new, nobody knew how to do it. Yeah, I've um and I see a lot of sad things like people teach a lot of bad kind of ways right now. Um and I mean there's a lot of really good coaches. Actually, somebody I was talking to recently was like, "Hey, like who do I go for coaching?" I was like, "I'm I'm actually a coach myself." But I was like, "There's majority really good

coaches in the space that actually genuinely want good for people." So, I think we're pretty good in that regard, but there's definitely a lot of like bad situations. >> So, how did it all start for you? Like, how did you even get involved in the space? >> Funny enough, I was moving from Hawaii to San Diego because I'm in the military even right now. um active duty right now currently and uh I was moving. Yeah, thank you. And uh I was moving for that and I was like I'm in a good amount of

debt. I was like I need to get out of some debt. I was like what's a good way to get out of this that has you know low risk high reward and I kind of found Tik Tok shop and I was like I'm going to try this and my first full month like first full dedicated month to it I made my full yearly salary from the military in profit and I was like this is crazy. So, I did 59,000 in profit my first full month. >> But at the time, okay, so here's what I'm trying to get, right? Like, and I've

talked to this about to a couple guys on their podcast, but like you're a military dude. >> Tik Tok, bro. Really? Like, and I'm not saying this cuz I grew up with socials, right? But like they had to have been like knocking on you and stuff. >> Yeah. I mean, to be honest, like it's I'm in such a small office space. There's only about three of us that work in my office, so it's very small. And definitely they were like, "This is kind of weird." Uh especially especially if I

was in Hawaii where my shop originally was where I'm like around 30 other guys. I'm a aviation rescue swimmer so all of us are really close tight-knit guys and if they would have saw me doing that they would have and they still roast me Ruben right now but it's all out of love which is good but >> Right. So and so you just saw past that and you were like I'm just going to do this like who inspired you to do it? Like how did you even know about it? >> Yeah honestly so Sedlac Alex Sedlac I

saw his stuff. Um he was posting about it. There's a ton of ton of people that were actually starting. It was like just kind of starting to get posted about and I was like, I need to hop on this if this is early because I couldn't tell if it was early. No one really knows like when it's early, right? It's still super early in my opinion. This is like still the beginning stages. I'm actually about to post a YouTube video about it because it's like I truly think this is like

probably 15% of where it's going to be. Um, so yeah, I saw that and I was like hopefully this is early. hopped on it and definitely was because I was making a good amount of money and I mean there's still people out there that are making crazy money even in their early stages of like maybe a couple months in which is like that just shows you that there's so much more potential for this at least from what I've seen. >> So when you when you started you were just like a regular dude in the

military. You didn't you didn't like you wouldn't try drop drop shipping or social media or >> I I actually had a I tried to sell on Amazon. I was like tried to build my own product. I went through a whole course actually I'm a huge supporter of courses. A lot of people hate them. I'm actually a fan of them. I bought courses a lot of times. But um and I found a ton of help through that. Ended up doing it really well, but ended up not having success with it long term because I

actually screwed myself over. But uh I I had that kind of I guess background of just selling stuff there. Um and then I was like, "Hey, you know, it's not this isn't working." So I didn't really have any social media background to be honest. I had built my profile that I currently do Tik Tok shop on. It was like country music clips from YouTube. I literally just like screen recorded country music videos and would post it. >> Why? Why were you doing that? >> I was just doing it for fun. I wasn't

doing it for any other reason. I was like, "This is kind of cool. I'm getting millions of views." >> Had the passion for country music. >> Yeah. And so I would just post that and then I was like, "Hey, maybe I could do Tik Tok shop with this." And I didn't relate the content at all. So it was like my page would be all country music videos and I'd post like retractable car chargers and they get millions of views. So it was like no relation. And I was like that's very weird.

>> Were you still doing the country? >> No, I stopped it completely. I literally just like 180ed and went right to Tik Tok shop, which again is not like you're not building anything long-term with that. I don't think like you're just selling shop content. And again, like that's great and you're making I'm making good money from that, right? And a lot of people do that and you're making good money, but like how long does that last until your brand presence

isn't there and you're drowned out by the millions of other people that start doing that? >> And that's what I tell people is like, you know, one of the reasons why I wanted to start Shopouse is because it's like the 1020-year plan, right? The fact that I did three million last year in sales means nothing anymore, right? Like the brands have moved on. The brands most some of those brands aren't even there anymore. >> Yeah. >> And it's like if you're not building

>> we're only building equity for these brands. >> Yeah. >> And they can sell it. They have, you know. >> Yeah. And that's the like that's why I say it's a good stepping stone. Yes. In my opinion. And I mean I say this to my sister all the time, you know, she's whatever she's number one in home and living right now and she's done actually 12 million in GMV now which is insane. So, it's like and she's making so much money, but like I also I think about

that. I'm like, you know, like this is you're only making as much as you have. You can't sell this. You can't like sell equity. You can't sell this company. Um, and again, I'm not I don't really know much about that business side of the world. That's why I'm actually trying to educate myself into that and move into that world as well now. But I see Tik Tok Shop affiliate as the best stepping stone to making money if you have no experience in business. I was like, I'm

an example of that. My mom is an example of that. My sister example of that. So that's where I think this is all heading and and good for beginners. >> I think me and you kind of are very similar because I think we're both real big family guys, right? So like I started YouTube when I was 11, ended up doing it full-time. Uh got my sister on board. Now she has 3 mil on tech and then like my mom >> is she had one of the biggest food and beverage companies and like now she or Tik Tok shops and now she does like

she's she was well she was just outlandish's top affiliate for Black Friday for the live stream. So, they're doing pretty good, too. Um, they do like my So, my whole family, right, my mom, my two brothers, and their wives, they all share one account, but they do eight hour streams and they take turns. >> That's crazy. >> So, they do that daily and they just take turns. >> That's wild. >> Yeah, it's wild. Um, but I think it's kind of similar in the fact that like

you want to see your loved ones succeed. >> You want to see them do well. >> Yeah. >> And I think that's really special and I think that's really good. >> There's like a portion to it that like I don't know. It it's like you get when you make money, it's like what are you going to do with it other than like have it for yourself, right? Like and it's nice, but like what else can you do? And I don't know. I got to a point where I was like, hey, I'm making a lot of money

and like my wife and I are supported enough to where it's like what? Like >> it wasn't fulfilling you. >> Yeah. Like I don't feel Yeah. I'm like I don't feel fulfillment anymore. Which again it was the biggest blessing of all time and it still is. But I was like what else do I do now? So like I am like okay well my sister needs this same thing. she's in the same place I was, how do I get her to have the same success? How do I have my mom have the same success? And it was just like that

continuous like road of like how do we have more people? Because then then you get the fulfillment from it. So, >> and it's interesting because your sister's like introverted, right? Like she's just kind of more >> Yeah, she's definitely more introverted, I would say. Not um not like terribly, but she definitely >> Yeah, for sure. Like, of course, [laughter] I'm going to China with her next month. Oh, really? So, yeah. That's awesome, dude. I saw that she was on the

list for Shenzen, so that's going to be cool. Yeah, >> I saw her at the uh You'll find You find after party. >> Oh, really? >> So, my wife and her were like hanging out for a while. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. >> See, that that's the type of stuff I'm like, I want to do that stuff, but I don't I can't even like I'm not even allowed to go to China because the military >> Oh, >> the military won't let me go. >> Right. >> You know, you're working on so many

different things, bro. You got Tik Tok shop, >> your community, your YouTube channel, >> your Nick Fowler account, which you educate and inspire. Um the military, your mom and your sister. >> What else you got on your plate? >> Um [sighs] so >> did I break everything down? >> Yeah. So >> the wife. >> Yeah. So I obviously So kind of my dayto-day, right, is like I'll work for the military, which takes up majority of my day. I get home and I immediately go

right into um Tik Tok shop affiliate. So I'm like, okay, what do I have to do for Tik Tok? I need to keep my credibility. I need to prove to people that, hey, like I'm still doing this um for if I'm if I'm coaching, right? So, I do that. I get that done as much as I can. I have the daylight hours that I have and then I go right into coaching. So, I'll work on the personal brand of like uh the mentorship posts on TikTok, um the YouTube stuff and then I also work in my obviously my coaching and like you know

I DM my co my clients and stuff. So, I do that >> and then uh whenever I have any leftover time to actually work I will um think about the future that I have. I kind of have, ever since the beginning of this, I've had kind of a plan of what I want to execute for long term. Um, and so I'm kind of diving into that right now. >> You still have multiple coaches in your in your community. >> Yeah, so both of my main coaches in my community are um it's more of a mentorship now. I've switched it over to

more of a mid-t mentorship program. Uh because I realized that the low ticket wasn't really fulfilling as much success students as my mentorship was. Like this the success rate was going a lot higher when I had a mentorship. So we switched over to that. Um way easier to manage, too. Who are your coaches in there? >> Uh, both of them are actually my friends from high school that I also coached on Tik Tok shop. They're at like 2 million GMBB each as well. Wow. And uh, they're basically doing that now.

>> I remember when I joined your community, like one of the coaches in there. I forgot who it was, but I was like, "Oh, dude, this is dope." Like Austin? Yeah. It was either Mike or Austin. >> They're your friends? >> Yeah. Yeah. They're friends from high school. They're actually my best man at my wedding, too, which is funny. >> Nuts. They were doing they were in your community like two years ago when I saw it or >> Yeah, they were from the start. Yeah,

>> cuz they they kind of were big figures, too, right? or are big figures on Tik Tok. >> Yeah, both of them uh both of them over two million GMBB like >> they were making videos about shop though, right? >> Uh tiny tiny bit like they're basically I'm all the person. >> I just remember when I joined your community, I recognized a coach in there and I was like, "Oh, this is I thought you had like partnered with I don't know. I don't know." Anyways, I I

thought it was really good and I thought your course was very uh useful and it just like taught it was great for all the basics, really nailing down everything. >> Um super easy to learn. >> Yeah. But so, okay, your personal brand, right? Like what when did you start that? When did you start the YouTube channel? >> I started the YouTube channel like six months ago. So, that's still kind of new for me. And, >> uh, the numbers are going up really well for only six months, I would say, which

is really nice. Um, >> but I'm definitely trying to like I'm trying to say how do I differentiate myself and and get more >> um I guess coaching and and good quality, good editing, long-term coaching for these people like hey like if you you know you don't get enough value from this one short video. How do I get you like long form stuff? So I'm looking in that direction and it's worked really well. So >> So are you an agency or you're just a mid ticket?

>> Uh no I'm not an agency. We have an agency. We don't use it. We're kind of using it for a lot of data for our clients. So, we're like, "Hey, like we can see your data now and actually track it and help them." Which is nice, but we don't use >> It's funny. I don't use mine either. >> Yeah. I'm like, "But I don't uh I don't have any of them on board because I'm like, "Hey, like we won't actually provide to you the services that a lot

of these other agencies will. So, I'd rather you go and apply for another agency and work with somebody that we actually trust. Ours is just so we can gather data for you to actually help you execute on your data, which is >> So, what's the what's the goal with the personal brand?" Because you have a lot of pull right now in the Tik Tok drop space. >> That's the So, that was the thing. I'm I'm definitely moving and I've kind of like been very strategic with this

entire personal brand. I I wouldn't have started my personal brand if I didn't have a a decision I was going to do. And the whole idea of it is one I can provide free value to people that people feel um almost there there's reciprocity to it. Like people feel like they want to reciprocate when I can give. And I like the idea of just giving and then like people will come back and give more, right? Like I feel like if I just sat there and just try to take stuff from people, it just doesn't feel right.

Whereas if I'm like, "Hey, I'm going to give to you and then you when you feel ready to give something back to me if you're willing, then all for it." Um, and so that's kind of my my strategy with it. I'm like, I'm going to give you as much free value as humanly possible. I'm never going to show you a flashy car. I'm never going to show you the watches I own or anything like that. My full my full strategy is just I'm going to give you as much free value. And with

that, I'm going to at some point launch a product is my has been my long-term goal. I was like, I want to launch a product with that audience that also one will buy from me and sell for me. So, that's like my kind of strategy. Um, and something that they can >> and help them make money. >> Yeah, exactly. I'm going to help you make money and then help you like like find a product that you're also passionate about too. Uh, and that's kind of the strategy I'm going into

right now. I'll be doing that. >> So, is that your announcement? You're dropping the product. >> Yeah. So, I'm dropping a product. It's going to be a deodorant brand. I've been for the past like six months I've been looking through tons of different products, a lot of market research of like different things and I found a lot of different weird ones. Like I like neuro stuff like neurological stuff was a huge one I was like looking into um just because of the market but I didn't

have any passion to it and I was like if I don't have a passion towards a product then I'm not going to continue with it. And that was where the problem lied. I was like I don't have any passion towards any of these things that like are pretty good for market research until I landed on deodorant. My family's like super my my my sister is very obsessive with deodorant. My mom's been like that. Breast cancer's been in our family. So, it's like kind of like a something we're pretty passionate about

and my my wife can't find any good deodorant. So, I'm like I how about I just solve this problem for ourselves and something that I would be passionate about. It's one like good margins, um low shipping cost, a high branded product. I can really brand that really well. Um and then also it's something like I actually want myself to and I'd be passionate about it. So, I'm kind of diving into that space and then I will be the whole goal of this like how I think your brand is centered around your

community and I'm very about community. I really want to make people feel like we're in this together kind of thing and that's kind of the direction I'm taking. It's going to be a completely creatorled brand. Like I will be making like kind of like, hey, here's the things, but everyone votes on it. Like you guys are the decision makers here. And that's kind of the way I'm going to take it. So, it's going to be a little bit different than most people. It's not

like, "Hey, here's my product. Here it is." It's going to be uh every creator, every Tik Tok shop affiliate has the choice and free choice to uh be a part of making this product with me. And then um >> and then you're going to send it to everybody in your group chat. >> Yeah, basically. And then and then >> Brandon leaked the chat, bro. I'm sorry to tell you. [laughter] >> Yeah, I know. >> Did he tell you? >> Wait, did he No, he didn't tell me.

>> Yeah, on his podcast. >> He talked about the chat. >> Dude, why'd you do that? [laughter] >> No, it's fine. Um, but dude, yeah, the that's where I think uh that's where I I've been wanting to head that direction because that's where I can have something I can sell one day and I can like I just like building stuff too. So, it's like that's a huge portion of it. Um, and like I'm a huge risk person. I'm totally willing to take a ton of risk

and I've always been that way. So, I'm like kind of moving that direction as well. But, yeah, I think that's a huge portion. And then also, it's going to be a very charitable brand. So, that's another big portion of it. I really want it to be cancer related charities that we give every month. And then the community votes on what charity to give to and it has to be cancer related. Um so that's what I want to do. I want to something every month is like a hey we're gonna vote these are the cancer

related charities we'd like to you know push. Which ones do you guys want to do? Something like that. I haven't really fully decided because I kind of want the the community to decide that too. I want the whole thing to be like kind of communityled. >> So at that point are you going to like go all in with the deodorant >> I >> and like stop doing some of the things that you're doing right now? Um, again, I've been using coaching as a as a portion to get to like a stepping stone

almost. Um, and >> but this was always the end goal. >> This has always been the end goal for me. Yeah. And so, the coaching is great because again, it builds my brand. I can um I can actually give to people a ton, which I don't think I'll really stop that because I I enjoy it. Uh, but yeah, it's always been like kind of a stepping stone like, hey, like I gave so much to my my audience, and I hope at least I hope I do. Like, I'm giving as much as I can to you guys. Um, I feel like now

like maybe like you can help me out here. Like I have a mission I want to go on and like you guys can be a part of that mission too and like feel like you're a part of this this product in this goal. So >> I love that, man. Congratulations. That's huge. >> Yeah, I'm excited for it. >> It's all been you've been so patient on it. >> Yeah, it's been two years. I I thought I I said first year is a full build. Uh second year is like I'm going to build

the personal brand really hard and 2025 was my personal brand year. Uh 2024 was my Tik Tok shop affiliate year. 2026 I want to be my u build the the brand itself. So that's why January 1 I'm officially announcing the brand. >> I love that man. Congratulations dude. That's huge. Yeah. I mean I think like a lot of the a lot of the top affiliates right now are saying that 2026 is their personal brand year. I've heard it from everybody in your group chat. Like everybody says the same thing.

>> Yeah. >> What do you feel like is the importance of like them building their personal brand? Um and like Yeah. Where do you feel like that's going? I think it's going to be I mean it's the most valuable thing you can have hands down by far right now in in this world right now the most valuable thing you can have is a personal brand and social presence and whether that be through Instagram through YouTube through Snapchat I don't know but just like if people notice who

you are and recognize you in some community whatever whe whether that's Tik Tok shop affiliate or whether that's you know cryptocurrency I don't know what it is that is the most valuable thing you can have because attention is leverage and you can use that leverage for pulling whatever thing you want. So, uh I I say that I say that right now. You need to find what you're passionate about and you need to uh give before anything and then you need to um expand that and grow it into some type of

counter position. So, like what do you what is everyone else doing in your space? How can you be different than them? Uh mine was when I started was like, hey, I'm just going to give as much free value as possible in the coaching space of Tik Tok shop affiliate because no one else was really doing it. Uh and then obviously you're doing that right now too. Like you're a complete counterposition to everybody else. like you're you're building this amazing media company that no one else is doing

to appreciate you. >> Yeah, dude. Like I think that is the the most valuable thing right now. >> I appreciate that. I mean I think for me when I when I started Shop House I think that for one I had my agency but >> also like when I stopped the agency to pursue this full-time and keep doing affiliate at the same time about a year ago. The reason why I wanted to do it is because like I felt like everybody was that was doing content around shop always had something to sell you or

always had something to like you know what I mean they had an offer which isn't bad right but it's just like nobody was like the full force influencer social commerce and I was like this is a gap that like I have passion for like I had when I started my agency a year ago like I had the brands on board I had the creators on board but like I wasn't passionate about that you know and so I was like I love creating content and Tik Tok shop is great selling and things But like, bro, at the

core, like I've been doing this since I was 11. >> Yeah. >> You know, and so being a content creator, like this is what fulfills me, right? Like making great I guess art. >> Mhm. >> Right. Like I'm a create I'm a creative and I think that that's the I think that's the thing. But >> uh who's your Mount Rushmore of Tik Tok show? >> Oh man. I my my immediate my immediate thought is Matt Matt Kala. like 100%. I think I look right to him because when I

started all my stuff, I looked to him initially, too. And I was like, "Hey, like you're the guy." Like uh tech was like uh the products that I was pushing and he was like the king of it. >> So, you think Matt's the goat? >> Definitely up there. Yeah, for sure. Definitely the goat. >> So, you you've known who Matt was for two years? Matt Ka, by the way, guys, who we just had on the podcast. >> Dude, I just found out who Matt was like three or four months ago.

>> Really, dude? >> So, I'm on my feed. So, I [laughter] didn't I never saw Matt before and now I text Matt every day. But when I saw it's funny, I tell the story to Matt every time. When I saw Matt's >> Tik Tok, it was I swiped a video and he was like, "So, I've done 18 million GMV." And I closed the app. I said, "Dude, these people are getting so bad with lying now. Who is going to believe that?" >> Wow. >> Like, that is so horrible. Whatever this

guy's selling, >> this is the worst lie I've ever heard. I literally laughed out loud. And I was like like cuz I closed the app and I was like I've been on Tik Tok shop two been Tik Tok long enough. >> I went to an event that week weekend Matt was there speaking. I [laughter] went up to him and I was like bro when I saw that video I thought you were lying. I have it on my video. It's so funny. Um >> that's crazy because like that's what I thought and then I was like there's

there's a lot of people that think that too and that's why I'm like I try to like bump down the numbers a lot. I'll be like, "Hey, like like this person made 10K. They really made like 50." But I'll say it's 10 because people don't believe the 50. Like that's how crazy the numbers seem. And like that's that stuff happens, which is so wild. >> Okay, so Matt's the first one. You got three more spots. >> Oh man. Uh Brandon Lush. Be Lush.

>> Okay, you're giving us Brandon Lush. >> Yeah, I just I'm thinking about content that I like like I really like to watch. Um, and Matt's definitely up there because he's so fun to watch cuz he's like, you know, it's this. Uh, [laughter] but then, uh, Lush is fun to watch. Uh, Brandon I am skateboard B. >> Skateboard B. >> Yeah. Uh, I forget the handles. >> All right. Brandon. >> And then, uh, Ally for sure because she's like the goat, too. So,

>> Ally, too. Brandon's in a mat. That's a good one. >> Yeah, that's a good one. >> Lushes was uh I mean I mean I can say it because because the podcast was out by now, but um just don't put it in your group chat. Lushes was Matt Ally, your sister. >> And who's his last one? >> I feel like it has to be I'm trying to think of the other chats. Oh, Kayla's doing crazy. >> It was another guy. I forgot who it was. I I I don't think it was B. Maybe it might have been

I don't know. I don't know. I forgot. We're gonna have to see. We're gonna have to see. We're gonna have to see who who it would be. I mean, there's a ton of people. I do know your sister was on there. >> Really? >> Um, >> yeah. I mean, it's interesting the way that like cuz it's still so new. It's hard to say Mount Rushmore cuz it's still so new. You don't know who's going to like But dude, like >> Oh, deals with Ty. >> Yes, it was Ty. I was like, Ty,

I'm trying to think of that cuz dude, >> so Tai's an OG for you, too. I just >> definitely 100%. I don't even know why, >> dude. And no disrespect to Ty. I I mean I've seen his on call data every month, but I never like I just texted him for the first time a week ago, but like I never really like dug into like him. >> Yeah, >> he's nuts. He's doing more sales than PopMart, >> dude. He's like I mean I I want to speculate, but his numbers are have to

be insane. Like unreal numbers. I think I think 2026 we're going to have the first million dollar commission month person in 2026. >> Kayla got close to it. >> Really? >> I mean Kayla, right? It was like 450 or something. I I I feel like has to be up there. >> That's true. >> He has to be up there now. Yeah. >> Um if not more, I would I would think. I mean, I don't know. We don't >> How did you So, when you when you got into TikTok, um how did you tap in with

all these big creators? >> Tap in like um >> like how did you get connected with them? >> Honestly, I would just DM. I'm a huge like I'll just DM everybody and be like, "Hey, like love your stuff." Or what I'll do is if someone's live, I'll just go and be like, "Hey, really like what you're doing." I'm just trying to like seed myself into their brain a little bit because I'm like, "Hey, I want to network with you." like there's

something that we can both mutually benefit. I do that with brands all the time, too. Uh if someone's like if there's someone has a personal brand and they also have a brand or a selling account and they have products, I'll do it all the time. I'll be like, "Hey, like you're like I really like your stuff or like um I'd love to I'm I'm trying out your stuff right now. I really like it." Uh I do that all the time just because I feel like there's always something you can benefit

mutually between each other and I love to network because you never know. >> Yeah. I mean, I did I did that recently with Optimized Minerals. Uh there I I was messaging him. I was like, "Hey man, like I don't know if there's something like um I really like your stuff and like I definitely see this thing like going even further than he's already doing crazy numbers." So I was like, "I want to just connect with you because I feel like there's something we could

help each other with." >> He just texted me yesterday, bro. >> Really? Wow. >> He like put like the sales are great, but what about this? And then he like responded like 30 I was like And he he responded 30 minutes later and he's like, "Wrong group chat." [laughter] >> So funny. >> But like he's he lives in Austin with us, so some guy was like, "Hey, can I please connect you with him? He'd be great for the pod." Um, dude. Yeah. I

mean, I think the craziest part about like knowing these big creators on a daily basis is like, dude, they're all they all have such good hearts. Like that's a cool thing I like about Tik Tok Shop coming from the influencer space is like there's no ego. >> At least when when you get up there, they're like the ego. I mean, they have nothing to prove. >> I think it's because everybody's the average person. Tik Tok shop is one of those few places where everybody is like

the average person that is having success. Like the big of influencers aren't really doing it as much. Like I mean some people are but like the average person is what makes Tik Tok shop affiliates so special. And that's why I think and this is what I say all the time is I think influencer marketing is slowly dying and Tik Tok shop affiliates are rising and I think that that's happening because people would prefer to buy from somebody that they look like, seem like, uh feel like, right? Like I'd rather buy from somebody

that seems like me or has the same issues that I do. I don't really relate to Kim Kardashian who's this, you know, figure that like, you know, people are going to buy from her. Sure. But like I would rather buy from somebody who has the similar things that I do. Yeah. And that's why Tik Tok shop affiliates, the average person is going to succeed in this world. >> I think when it comes down to conversion, I think that the brand deals of like the 20K to 100K follower influencers is probably going to

diminish because now brands are going to be very it's going to be very transparent on the conversion and like who's converting, right? Cuz like >> I come from the days of like a brand wanting to throw 10K >> and they don't know if they're going to get their money back, right? Like they don't. But now they can literally transparently see the numbers. You know what I mean? >> 100%. And like if you show that you have performance, like think about it. You have performance data to show that you

will perform as a creator, they're going to hop on that all day. Like why wouldn't they? >> It's insane. >> I'll be like I'd rather just have this person that can build uh trustworthy brand presence for us and sell for us. Uh, and yeah, of course, like influencers are always going to be there and they're always gonna like they'll take the loss sometimes just for the brand presence and like the the uh what is that called? Correlation between the influencer like oh this person now

correlates with that brand. But I don't brand recognition. >> Yeah, brand recognition. But it's not like >> it's like if you want conversions, you're going to go to the average person that like has a micro influencer following. So >> yeah, it's nuts. And then they can just run ads on it and stuff like that. It's it's super interesting the way that this game's going. >> So you've been on a podcast run. >> Yeah. Yeah. What's the goal of this

whole podcast run that you've been on, man? >> Uh, honestly, just podcasts. You can so much power in podcasts, dude. It's so insane. Like, I didn't know that until I was on my first podcast just because that was like I won the school games back in like August of 2014. >> You won the school games. >> Yeah, I came first in the school games. Uh, cuz I built my community up. Um, and then that first month we came first place. >> You were first in the school games?

>> Yeah. This is like OG beginning of school, too. So, it was like kind of like smaller, I guess. >> Did you meet her? Yeah. Yeah. We got to meet Heroszi, spend a day with Hermosi and then um Sam Ovens got to have like dinner with Sam Ovens, the owner and stuff. It was pretty cool. >> Wild. >> Yeah, it was fun. It was definitely unique because I again I was still brand new to the whole world of >> But they probably had no idea what Tik Tok shop was. >> Yeah, no one really understood it.

Hermosi since that since we had that event has been talking about Tik Tok shop as well now. Ever since >> I think they're all starting to >> Yeah, they're starting to figure it out. They're like, "Oh, like a lot of, you know, communities are coming up. A lot of people are talking about it. Influencers, Gary Vee, everybody." >> Yeah. I mean, it's wild. I've been in talks with with Gary and he's definitely ready to like start hitting. So, you might get a you might get an invite to a

dinner pretty soon. I'm just I'm just putting that out there, man. We got some stuff that we're cooking. Um that's awesome. >> And uh and like Damon John followed my account. >> Oh, yeah. You were mentioning that, dude. That's so crazy. >> How much did I tell you? I forget the things that I'm [laughter] We're all talk. I do the same thing. >> But yeah, it's uh it's interesting because they're all trying to figure out how they can tap in.

>> They all want to they this is going to be the biggest thing, you know, >> 100%. Where where do you feel like um do you think the lives are gonna overtake the videos? >> I so I think it's where's where does Tik Tok want to push it? And like I think live streams are naturally what people are going to want to buy from, but what do the creators want to do? And so the creators are naturally still incentivized to do videos more than lives, right? Like I think from what I've noticed, they're just more

incentivized to push videos because it's like easier. you get a better return on your time and so the creators are doing that but but live streams like are better for the brand I think generally like they're like like okay well uh for per viewer we're getting more sales like you know per viewer we're getting a better conversion uh and I think for their time too I'm not sure but I think that's just the general >> because consumers I'd rather buy from a live stream than buy from a video as a

consumer I'd rather see somebody demonstrate a product be able to ask questions um and purchase that product right there and especially on a flash discount or whatever it is. Like I can only get that discount right there. I'm buying it every time. So that's where I think it's going to head. Uh but I don't think we're at that point yet. So that just shows that there's so much more >> for this to go. >> And what do you think about when the when the influencers come in?

>> I don't know. I again I don't think that the influencers will take over much because I I again I'm trying to think of it from a consumer perspective. If I were a consumer scrolling on TikTok, I would rather buy from somebody that shows me that they as a normal person are a normal person as in like a not a big influencer uh have solved the problem that they had with that product. I'd rather buy from that person than if um I don't know uh Kim Kardashian, right? Like was like selling me this

product that I had that same issue. I wouldn't necessarily trust her as much because I'm like you don't relive anything similar to the life that I live. >> I don't think I'm concerned so much with the Kim Kardashians and the Rocks and the Kevin Harts. I'm concerned with like the kaisenats and like you know what I mean like people that have actually built relationships with their audience that do what we do that are like social media influencers. Like what I was just

talking to somebody about the other day is like >> when a makeup brand has a choice between giving like a retainer or like doing a mega life with James Charles or like an or like a shop creator with >> 10K followers that has done 10 mil GMV, who are they going to go with? >> You know what I mean? And maybe there's a world for both. Maybe it's like they're James Charles's co-host, but >> that's the only thing that I tell my friends like, "Hey, >> I think in that world, yeah, I mean, I

think I think the Kaisenets of the world are definitely going to take that prize, I guess." >> But they might not even want to though cuz I was at the Tik Tok awards last night. >> Part of it. Yeah. >> I was at the Tik Tok awards last night and I had seen a lot of old creators for my YouTube uh career and you know, they're like, "Dude, where have you been? We haven't seen you in forever." >> And I'm like, "Yeah, dude. Tik Tok shop. Da d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d

d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d like these people are making they're like cool." >> Yeah. They're like, "No, >> not interesting." >> Really interesting. >> They're just love with doing the basketball content or whatever their >> I guess it's the passion, too. Like, what's your passion? And if it's >> I think a lot of creators do it for passion, not for money. >> Yeah. And that's good, too. It's like do

do what you're happy with. >> I think a lot of influencers do merch and build businesses because they have to. >> Yeah. >> And because a manager comes and tells them in their ear. But I think at scale, I mean, I think at like I think most creators would just be happy just making content. Yeah. Well, that's the thing. Um, I think you have to decide in yourself, are you going to be a business owner or you going to be a creator? You have to like make that decision. >> And I think like even just myself, I'm I

definitely lean more towards the business end of things. Like I would I like build is as long as I feel like I'm building something. And I feel like that leans a little bit more towards the business end of things. But, uh, >> but creators definitely have that sense of building. You have the sense of building something. You see the views go up. You see the subscribers or the followers, right? So, there's that sense of building, too. Um, but I think you have to decide in yourself like are you

a business owner or you're a creator and if you follow the creator and like you are definitely like um >> I just had this conversation. Um, >> yeah. I mean for me dude like when it comes to business and creator I'm creator all day like I get my passion again I think it's more like creating art creating stuff that people makes people enjoy laugh >> um I guess it's art but also I mean there comes a fine line where there's no money in art right like I was here in LA

trying to be an actor all last year >> and these like >> these people that I'm in class with dude like they're like grinding their butts off because they're passionate but like they're like working like 10 hour shifts trying to be an actor for like 10 years and I was like there's something wrong here, dude. >> You know what I mean? Like there's something wrong with this whole system that like Hollywood becoming an actor. Um, but I think that you kind of have to

be 50/50. You have to be 50% suit and 50% creative. >> My my initial thought in that is like where is the world going too? Like >> I think naturally there's so much competition in that space too. I mean again I don't know that space that well but like I feel like there's so much competition in that like everybody's trying that and so that makes it so much harder whereas like the where is the world shifting to and the world I feel like is shifting towards obviously social media and more and more so um I

think I also think the social media bubble is going to pop in like 20 years >> is my my idea because something will take its place like if you looked at like 2000 you're right like no one really thought of social media like that um and then obviously here it is now so I think It's probably got and then something else will take its place like the whole new like thing. I don't know whether that's like something that's like the internet that like VR or something like something just like we

can't even imagine right now or perceive. Uh something will take its place. I think that's just my random thought but like right now it's like that's still the direction it's heading like social media are like the the um actors of the world now. So, >> so and and if if somebody told you tomorrow, right, like Nick, you can never be on camera again or you can never do business again, >> which would you choose? >> Oh, one of the one of the two. Oh, man. I think

I think I would probably naturally choose creator. Naturally, like because I >> that's the thing because I feel like I need the I need one for the other. Like I but I need one for the other. Like I can't do just creator and not have the business. But I enjoy the creator end, but I enjoy the business end. I don't know. That's hard. Yeah. I don't even know. I don't know. >> What gives you more fulfillment, I guess? >> Oh, man. >> You make a lot of videos.

>> Yeah. I don't know. I I guess I naturally think creator. >> And if Tik Tok shop went away tomorrow, like Tik Tok shop as a whole, >> what's where would you go next? I probably would go uh entertainment route as a creator. I think I would I would start and build that up with a personal brand again. Uh but I would do that through entertainment. And >> have you enjoyed the whole like YouTube journey that you've been on? >> Yeah, it's been fun. It's definitely So

that's a huge part of my my thing is I need to I need to pay down ignorance. I think that's a Herozi quote actually, but but I I believe in it. I'm like I need to pay down my ignorance. I don't know anything about the YouTube world and I don't know how to film YouTube. I don't know how to sit down in front of a camera and not hold the camera. like me holding my phone is a huge portion of my like kind of comfortability. And so sitting down in front of a camera with my arms on the table and talking is just

really uncomfortable for me. But that's kind of the point why I'm doing it. I'm like I need to also be used to this. I need to like learn how to do this. Um and so I can feel like I have my hands in everything and I'm not like vulnerable from any point. Uh so that's been a huge part of it and I really enjoy it. I like it now. It's definitely fun. I just uh it's just hard to like I don't know. I feel like I need to move. I'm a very active mover when I'm talking. I don't know why, but

>> yeah. >> Interesting. Maybe you need to have like a moving podcast or something. >> I know. That's actually a thought of mine because that's a huge thing I've noticed too with like podcasts having like uh very unique things to them. Like I saw one podcast like they were getting a massage. It's like the guy has a massage. They get a massage every time they have a podcast and they're sitting on the table and they're talking to the camera that's on the floor during the

podcast. >> Well, that's very interesting. >> That's the secret to going viral on social media, right? It's like it's like Mr. says like the purple elephant like you're gonna you know the purple elephant theory. So like one of the things one of the advice that I gave uh to somebody in Austin was like he's like bro you don't understand we're going to have these billionaires on the show we're going to have these multi-millionaires >> and I'm like your show is just going to

like st it's not going to stand out in a crowd full of people like >> you going through the McDonald's drive-thru with them >> that's what's going to attract people. Yeah. X meets Z, right? Like it's or Z Y meets Z. Like >> matching the polar opposites. So it's pretty, you know, >> I've noticed that. And like that's one of the things I was like, if I did a podcast for myself, I would >> like call it the walk and talk or something. I I thought of this randomly

once and I was like, man, I really want to do a podcast now. But it was it was like I would walk with my guests somewhere and we'd go on a walk and >> I mean, dude, realistically, it's all about telling the story and it's all about the content. I don't really think the quality matters. You could have a GoPro. Yeah. >> And just like us with the DJI and like people would find that intriguing. >> Um but yeah, I mean I think that social media is a whole different ball game

>> um than Tik Tok shop. So what do you feel like are the core fundamentals to sell on Tik Tok versus like being a creator? >> The core fundamentals is product and quality, right? Quality video. So everybody gets and this is I this is my foundation for everything. My I I say the same thing to my wife when she started Tik Tok shop. I was like, all you need to focus on, don't literally listen to anything else. All you need to focus on is make sure making sure you find a good product that you can solve

the problems for your own life with and then make good content with it. Now, obviously, make good content is a very loaded thing, right? But, uh, like what are the foundational skills that you need to learn to make this content and make it entertaining, make it enjoyable to watch, have some urgency so people purchase that product and then also on top of that um demonstrate that product, showcase the problems being solved with it. And when you can do those two things and you master those two things, you'll

make money. That's it. You don't need literally anything else. People were talking about like when time to post, what hashtags to use, uh like so many algorithm changes. I promise you, she didn't know what GMV even stood for, what even was. She was like, "What's GMV?" And she made two grand her second month. She only put in like 10 hours of work and she she literally doesn't even understand anything about Tik Tok. So, it's like shows me that like you don't need any knowledge really. You just need

to focus on those two things. And that's what she did. It worked. So, >> what do you feel like are the biggest changes from like two years ago when you were starting to like now like that we need to be aware of? >> Uh, bigger brands. That's probably the number one. Bigger brands are coming on. Um, and I think 2026 is going to be the the the shifting moment. Uh, I think 2025 is still very very well unknown. Um, and I think 2026, 2027 are going to be the big shift years of like the big

brands are now flooding in. Um, I think mostly 2027 is my guess because if you really think about it, the average person walking down the street doesn't know, doesn't understand Tik Tok shop. The average brand hasn't even really thought about it too much, I think. Uh, and this is just coming from my perspective as a creator, right? But like like I look I ask students, I'm I'm a teacher in the military, so I ask my I ask my students, I'm like, "Hey, you guys know about Tik Tok shop?" I'm just

like I just want to hear like as these they're like 19-year-old kids, so I'm like very interested to hear their thoughts. And they're like, "Oh, yeah. Like that's like the thing you can you can like buy off of it's like Shopify, right? They like don't really truly understand too much. They kind of know you can buy from it, but they think that it's like Shopify and that it's like a link to Shopify from Tik Tok. And I'm like, oh no, it's like it's Amazon but

in Tik Tok. It's like already integrated. It's a closed loop system. And they like don't get that and they're like, I've seen a couple things or maybe one of them is like bought from it, right? Or a couple of them have maybe bought from it, but it's very little. like they don't no one really understands and they none of them have ever said that they've heard of people making money through it like good money as an affiliate. So I'm like such an untapped thing still.

>> What do you feel like is the biggest dilemma of like you think it's education or you think it's the mainstream? >> I think it's just too early still like like you're talking about like how >> like why are more people not jumping on it? >> I think just people don't know. People don't know. Like I was just on another podcast before that and the guy was like I don't even know what that is. I don't even know what [laughter] Tik Tok shop is. Like he had no no understanding. So,

I think it's just like what do you surround yourself? What's your feed look like? And if the moment you start falling into the feed, like you'll be like, "Oh, this is obviously a huge opportunity." Um, I don't know. That's just my thoughts. Obviously, we're like so integrated in the community. >> That's what I was going to say. It's like day every day. That's all just consumed. >> You're like, "Oh, this is the whole world right now. The whole world's

talking about Tik Tok." It's like, >> right. No. >> And then that's what I'm saying is so it was a wakeup call for me yesterday at the Tik Tok awards. >> Yeah. >> Because I'm like, "Oh, Tik Tok awards. Tik Tok shop. Here we go." [laughter] Dude, it was literally like 3% of the awards. 3%, bro. It was like Tik Tok shop. >> And now the ad toart, boom, done, over with. Back to Keith Lee and back to food reviews and back to Entertainer of the

Year. And I'm like, it was a wakeup call to me because I'm like, dude, >> Tik Tok as a whole is still really focused on >> so many different branches. >> Yeah. >> Like especially with the acquisition with um >> with Larry Ellison and all them, Oracle, bro. Like just happened, right? also own massive media companies. I think uh bro, I'm going to butcher this, but I think >> Larry Ellison and the family, let's see. >> Yeah, I was about to say,

>> what companies do Larry Ellison own? All right, so he owns >> Oracle and um >> Oracle, but like he owns media companies. >> I didn't even know that. I don't know anything about this world. >> What media companies do the Ellison's own? So, they own Paramount. >> Oh. Oh, wait. I knew that. I knew that. >> Uh, MTV, Nickelodeon Comedy Central, Pluto. >> Wow. >> Tik Tok. >> Yeah. >> I think that Tik Tok is going to be the

one-stop shop for all media, everything, >> sports, movies. Uh, >> you feel like there's an integration, like kind of almost a merge of that in a way. are going to make that the centralized. I don't think there's going to be a media source bigger than I think we're going to all go to Tik Tok for everything. So, when we're looking at shop, that's going to be the business side of it, right? But I think >> music is massive with Tik Tok, right? Tik Tok wouldn't be Tik Tok without

music. And the artists and you know, um and then you have the live. >> Yeah. >> Which they're really really doubling it down on just live, not shop, just live. And >> that's going to be a huge push for them. I think that's probably going to be a bigger push than Tik Tok shop as a whole moving forward in the next year just live. >> Which is good though too. A lot of people are like we they need to push shop more. I'm like I wouldn't push it too much more because to be honest like

you don't want to taint the audience that loves and enjoys Tik Tok the app itself. >> Well and I also think like people like me and you need to diversify, right? So I think it's not just going to be like Tik Tok shop is the end all beall. I think it's whatnot. I think it's YouTube shopping. I think it's Facebook shopping. I think it's um >> Instagram shop. >> LTK. Yeah. >> Um, eBay Live, Fanatics Live, >> like there is so much more at play to

the social shopping world. And I think like >> uh I mean in China, bro, there's like 400 different apps that they use for social shopping. >> So crazy. >> It's so wild. I was literally just looking at a graph about like how Amazon took off and is it Dowin as I pronounce it? >> Do yen. >> Do yen. Uh, do yen took off and then Tik Tok shop is growing in their graph as well. It's such an interesting look because I'm like, "Oh, we're so early. It's it's it's so early.

>> We're so early." And you know what? It's funny because like when I originally had um Will on the podcast from Outlandish, >> like, "Bro, Will was around for like the start of bike dance in China." >> And what Will tells me is like everything that is happening here has already happened in China. So like influencers think they're too cool for Tik Tok shop. That was Will. He thought he was too cool for, you know, he says and then he started it and he realized

the opportunity. Um, so he's seen the whole picture >> and um, I think that like we need to study China more to learn more about what's going to happen over here. I think that obviously the audiences are different and like they're used to buying quicker but >> um, I think there's a lot to learn. I don't like I don't know, man. Social shop social commerce is just starting in the US, >> dude. QVC >> Yeah. >> live social shopping network from TV.

They're just like pulling out, you I think I think that's the idea that everybody's going to use these social media platforms as a searching, right? Like the search portion of like, hey, what does that place look like? Or what is that um hotel I want to go to? Can I search for it? And just see video footage of it and like more of a entertaining like just give yourself more of a visual of what you're looking for. And I think that's what Tik Tok is going to move to. Uh and I mean it's

already moved in that direction, but that's what everybody as a consumer wants to do, too. Like I want to be able to see that product in use and ask questions about it instead of like if you go on Amazon like I only see the photos and I don't know if I fully trust that product before I purchase. Everybody's felt that way. They're like like I want to see more photos. I want to see like someone use a demonstration video and those demonstration videos are awful like every time. And so it's like

how do you get something better? You get somebody who's live with that product right now you can talk to. You get an answer for it. You can see them do something with it. You can tell them to do something with it maybe. And I also think like we're talking about c celebrity mega lives and things like that but um I was listening to a podcast uh with I think it was this founder of Oracle uh Max and he was saying that like when his boy went to China right >> um he was looking for a specific pair of

Jordans >> and he searched up on an app or on the web that pair of Jordans that he was interested in. >> There was six live streams all selling that product at the same time. So he went to the best one with the best deal and bought it and the one that was answering his questions. >> Yeah. >> So I think >> like I think there's a world for like these celebrity mega lives, but I also think like I think every shop is going to have their own store selling one product at a time. Like it's just like I

feel like there's going to be so many live streams, >> so many different stores going live. And I think it's going to be like where you type in a product like I want this mic. >> Boom. Sure mics. There's like 10 people live with the SH mics just selling that one product, the DB uh 7 or M SM7, dude. So, >> I think it's it's a fascinating world. >> Yeah, I think it's only growing for sure. I mean, it's obvious. >> Yeah. >> So, >> yeah.

>> So, what would be what would be your best advice if somebody wants to start Tik Tok shop today? >> Best advice is go get free value from somebody, right? Like if you're if you've never done Tik Tok shop before in your entire life and you want to learn today and you're trying to get f like fast growth uh and get there moving quickly, start making money as quick as possible. First thing before anything is I would definitely go find like YouTube content. Obviously I have free value on

YouTube. Um there's other creators out there too. Uh I would find a coach that you resonate with that you trust and you believe in. Um hopefully I'm one of those, but but there's other ones too that are good. So I would like go see who you resonate with. Um learn from them. like kind of just taking in some information as as much as you can and then I would just start like getting the ball rolling like move like start posting as much as you can and then start getting Tik Tok shop products

start posting it's just like you kind of learn as you go like everybody's different uh but also my biggest tip to people too is like find your flaw like quote unquote flaws that other people you might perceive as flaws and find products that solve those problems and and sell them. Uh, I tell there's so many stories of people that are like, "Oh, I had this thing and the product solved that problem and I showcased that and made a ton of money off of it." There's so many. But people don't think

that way when they find products. They don't want to think about their flaws naturally. So they, you know, quoteunquote flaws, but they don't think about those things. So they don't want to find the products for them. But if you think about those things, like what are the things that I think about myself that maybe like I wish I I could change because other people think that way and find those products as fast as possible because you'll make so much money from it because there are other people like

you, not just you. >> So think of the customer's problems >> and your problems as well. >> Yeah. >> So you're not looking at you're not looking at sales or rankings or anything. You're just thinking about the psychology of a customer. >> Psychology is number one before all of it. I think the psychology is number one. The the data behind those products for sure, but I'm always and my sister's pretty much the same way too. She's like, I'll promote a product that has

almost no sales. Uh, and it'll it'll she'll take it off. She'll like take it to the moon because if you think about the psychology first, you look at that product and like, is this a unique product that I have a unique way of selling? I have a unique feature, too. Um, I just think of the example Miguel. He's a client that I I coach as well. He had this one video that was like he has eye bags and you've probably seen his videos, super viral. Um he has the eye bags and he was like, "Hey, like I have

these eye bags. I want to solve this problem for myself." So he got the uh I forget what it's called, the some product. And you rub it under your eyes. Yes. You rub it under under your eyes and it it like kind of like slowly pulls the eye bags away. >> The haries. Yeah. The stick. >> Yeah. I don't remember what it is. No, it's not the Harry's. It's something else. I can't remember. But >> Oh, the metal thing. >> Yeah. Uh no, it's not the metal thing

either. It's like a cream. It's a creamy like paste or something you put under. But uh but he used it and all he did was just be honest and truthful and real with people and he was like, "Hey, this is something I've dealt with my entire life." And he just showcased that and was like, "Hey, look, watch this and it's going to solve the problem." And so he showcased it solving the problem. And obviously it delayed because it was like something that you had to watch in real

time. And so that held his retention time in the video, which boosted it, sent it to more people. And uh and it was also just an interesting watch. It was just interesting to watch this guy who um didn't work or doesn't have any relation to cosmetics in any way uh go I've dealt with this and there's other guys like me and I want to solve this problem does it and it solves the problem actually showcase it's really actually pretty interesting to watch too and just sells so much of it. So it's

like a lot of people like him or other people that have these kind of quotequote flaws wouldn't think that way and they wouldn't go oh I want to get that product because of that. they just look all at the data and then they have no way to really showcase this product that they can't use. Um, and so that's the way that I've thought about it and I tell people I'm like, I can't necessarily give you the perfect product all the time because I don't know your life. I don't know your world. Um, only

you do. So like here's the products that you know quote unquote are trending based on data, right? Um, and things I think will take off. But but does it work with you specifically? Yeah. You >> know? Yeah. So do you think that organic is dead? >> No. No, I don't think so. I think uh >> because you said your sister can blow up a product. >> Yeah, I think I think it will. I think so there's there's portions to this. I don't think it's like dead or alive like

straight cut and dry. I think there's portions to it. I think naturally uh if you convert organically you will get ad spend behind it too. Uh but I don't think I don't think it's like dead on either end. I think it's like there's a healthy mix currently. Um that's what I've seen but I don't know. So if you're looking at the big brand, So if you're looking at the big brands that are like pushing GMBB Max, a lot of creators are just like flocking from trend to trend

to trend to Ninja to Shark to What do you think of like should we not be doing that? >> Um I think and I've kind of gone back back and forth with this because I feel like things shift very quickly right now. But I was I I definitely thought like yeah, move to the ones that have a lot of ad spend and but then that's the problem lies is that all the ad spend gets put on the big creators currently is what I've seen. So maybe go to the and I've saw another creator talk about this and

I 100% agree that that's definitely a thing is move to those brands that have a uh a larger ad spend but there's not a lot of creator competition with um and there's a ton that are going to be flooding in the next two years. So it's like there's I think right now we're in a weird shifting moment where like there's not a ton of big brands have huge ad spends like there are you know smaller brands that do but uh 2026 2027 are going to be like a lot of big brands are coming in. It gives us more to play

with. Uh but right now we're in a weird shift where like yeah those big brands are kind of being swallowed up by big creators. I would say u but that doesn't mean there's no money in the small brands too. Like I always tell my creators like a little simple way to look at it just simple. But if it's a blue check company and um then it's like they probably have some ad spend and if there's a low amount of creators pushing their products like you could probably be their top creator pretty quickly as

long as you make good you know content. So that's like my go-to little thing. But >> what are your favorite brands that like you would like lose it if they were on shop? >> Oh man. >> What do you want to promote >> other than your own obviously? >> Yeah. Um I don't know. I think like any I mean I don't know. Everything's already on. >> You think anything would like kill it on shop? That's not on there. >> Lheed Martin. I'm just >> What is that? It's it's a it's a missile

defense company that works for like the military, [laughter] >> but they actually do have like clothing now, which is kind of weird. I don't know why they do that, but >> so funny. >> Or like a Boeing. >> Yeah. [laughter] Yeah. >> No, I don't know. I don't know. I can't think of anything cuz like everything I already want I mean >> uh like Bibong just came on. I really like their clothing. Silver quicks. I really like >> Are you verticalizing or are you still

just doing whatever you like? >> I I talked to the verticalization team a lot and I I think what they're doing is right. I think verticalization is the right direction for Tik Tok and as a consumer I think that's what people will want but that's not what Tik Tok's algorithm is like doing right now like you look at the big creators follow what where the money's at right now like what is the money showing the big creators are promoting anything that they really want obviously there are some that like

verticalize really well um like one of my clients uh Brody I think he does all gym equipment and that's just like he's just really passionate about it he's like I don't want to like I don't want to try anything else just gym equipment and it works for him uh So, I don't know. That's what I've noticed. >> What are some of your biggest success stories that you've had with clients? >> Okay, so my sister's at 12 million GMV. Uh, my mom's at 2 or 3 million GMV. I'm

at 3 million GMV. My two best friends are 2 million GMV each. Uh, my physical therapist brother, he does he's like one one of the top live streamers. He does like 40k a month commission. Uh, and then I think he's at over 2 million GMBB. Uh, I have a ton of other like random clients that like I'll be like, "Oh, I forgot like we were working together a couple months ago and then finally like they took off." Um, or they took off. I don't know. There's tons. But I think total like for data that I

can prove with screenshots that people have sent me because that's the only thing I have other than I guess I could use the agency, but um, it's over 22 million in mentorship GMV that I've coached personally, but I know it's over 50 million. I just don't have the proof for it, so I don't claim it. But I know for a certain it's 22 million. And your sister's half of that. >> Yeah. Which is crazy because that's like obviously like me and her still work together on like product selection and

stuff, but uh obviously she's mostly, you know, stepped out. >> Did you ever think that your sister would have this much success? >> I I had a good feeling, right? Cuz like I mean this is still really early. Like I when I started Tik Tok shop, I made money like right away. It took her like three months. And to her in that world, it was like that was so long because she saw me right away success. She was like, "Oh, three months. Like this is I'm not having any success." But then she made

70k her third month so in profit. So I was like and then ever since then it's been over 50k commission every month or 100k commission every month uh since then. So she's like one of the most consistent creators I've ever seen. Um or you know as much as I know. But yeah I was not I didn't expect it to go that well. Like I was like that's crazy. >> Yeah. That is nuts. >> Yeah. I don't know. >> That is nuts to pass up like most of the top creators. >> And it's just one account too. Just one

Tik Tok account and that's it. Yeah, >> that's insane. >> Crazy, dude. >> Wow. That's incredible. Well, dude, thank you so much for coming on the podcast. I mean, is there anything that we didn't touch or that we didn't cover? Like, >> not really. I'm uh January I mean, this will probably be out sometime, but January 1st, I'm announcing my uh process of building my deodorant brand. Um, and every creator is more than welcome to join me on that process

because it's built by creators. Like, I want the creators to all be a part of it. It's a very charitable thing. So, like I'm also thinking about a portion where people like if they donate um or they pay they get more access to like voting in other things or deciding certain things and all that money is donated to charity. Um I want to be a very charitable brand uh and just build something fun. So, something that all the creators feel like they can come together for a good cause and also

something that we can build that we enjoy. So, yeah. >> Incredible, man. Well, listen, I think that you're probably one of the hardest workers on Tik Tok shops. So, shout out to you for getting your workout in, getting your army in, getting your your wife, your sister, your mom, your business, your personal coaching, your Tik Tok shop, your YouTube, your thumbnails, everything, bro. >> Thanks, man. >> Congratulations on everything, man. Thank you, brother. Thank you. Subscribe
