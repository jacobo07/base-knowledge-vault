Today we're getting an exclusive look at the king of Tik Tok shops exclusive studio tour. Never before seen on YouTube or social media, he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on this studio. And Brandon Lush has done over $13 million in sales just from his cell phone in less than a year and a half. Today we are getting exclusive access to see how he films his videos, where he films them. It's all going down. >> Mr. Brandon Lush. Today we are all the way out here in the middle of Texas.

Tell us about this. How did you build it? When did you build it? >> This is a 30x60 fully metal building completely dedicated to doing Tik Tok shop. >> I know we talked about this earlier. Can you show us where it started off before? >> I remember I was sitting in here. >> So when you bought the property, did you know you were getting into Tik Tok shop or were you making any money? >> I did not. I had no idea. So >> this is the original. >> This is the original.

>> So why did you start in here instead of just like doing it in your house like everybody else? >> Um one with kids that's hard. no matter how quiet you want them to be, they're always making noise. But also, um, for like acoustics, you know, I felt like it was >> and to have a nice background. Um, you know, in the house, it always seemed like you're just kind of in front of a white wall. I I started seeing some early success and I felt like it was really going to grow. And in order to

really lock down a good place to do it, I kind of wanted I'd seen maybe I can't remember who it was, but someone doing it in a shed and I was like, man, I have a shed. Before when you first when I started, you couldn't even walk in the store. There was so much crap in here. So I I bought a shipping container and uh there's a bunch of stuff in there too now. My first good month with Tik Tok was June I made like 50 grand and I was doing it in there. So it's kind of a mess. >> So that kind of changed. So this is all

Tik Tok shop stuff too or just project stuff? >> Project Tik Tok shop stuff for building that shop. I uh I took the leap of faith early though. One of my biggest months before recently was last year in September and that's when I decided I was going to do this. And so I had one of my biggest months in sales and I was like I'm going to reinvest. What was that biggest month? >> I did 180,000 in profit that month. >> That's crazy. >> I did 250 recently. >> 250,000 in one month.

>> Last month. >> How what was the cost of this whole building? >> Probably by the time it's all said and done with um electrical, air conditioning, everything. I'm I'm probably around 200,000. >> 200,000? >> Yeah. >> So, you said everything in here Tik Tok shop. >> Everything. >> All right, let's get into it. I'm excited. >> Oh my goodness. So, in addition to you building all this, you built this twotory thing right here as well.

>> Yep. >> What are we looking at right now? What is the purpose of this area? >> This is kind of my main workbench area. I film a ton of videos right here. Every I'm always using this as my background looking straight at these uh you know, lights and metal cabinets. But I would say 50% if not more of my videos are filmed right here. Um it's also where all my packages and everything come in and and go through everything. And >> so we got like the lighting, >> your big lighting guy. big lighting guy.

I think it's plays a big factor in quality of, you know, I film using an iPhone all the time still. >> So, I know this is big like for production, but they're on Tik Tok shop now. >> They are. >> Wow, look at that. >> I actually, it's one of those things I bought and I didn't look at the size >> and so I got these two giant boxes and I was like, what did I order? And I opened it. I was like, I I I bought the sun. >> Okay. And then over here, I see we got a

lot of like the newer Ray-B bands. All these were sent for free. So, how did this work? Were you hit up by the company before they were on shop? >> I as soon as they got on shop, I got a I got a message from them and they asked me to to promote them and at that time they actually sent me the offer with a bunch of sample options and I know like quickly after that they were only letting people get like one pair at a time. >> Um but but yeah, they uh reached out and so I have >> probably gotten like eight pairs of them

now. There's more than just that. >> This is all >> Yeah, all those knives are from TikTok. I didn't even know that they Wow. >> I saw that CGB, which is a bigger knife brand company, they they got on TikTok. I saw it in January of this year. And um so I jumped on it right away. My previous job was a hunting outfitter, so knives have kind of been a part of my not like this though. You know, I've never had a knife collection like this. [laughter] Um but they they came on

board and I had some recent early or some early success with them and it blew up. And so, uh, what you're seeing here is about six different knife companies, collection of almost every knife that they offer on TikTok or had offered at one point. >> What does like the sales price of a knife look like? >> So, most of them are around $50 to $80, but there's some in here that range between 100 to 600. >> Okay. And then what does like commission look like on a knife? >> Typically, it's about 15%.

>> Got it. Got it. >> So, how many like how many knives have you sold to for them to send these? So CGB I I was looking the other day and for the year CGB was my third biggest brand. >> Oh really? Out of everything here, >> right? So >> Okay. So you sold a lot probably millions of dollars in knives. >> Yeah, it was close to that. At the first month I did about $100,000 in the knives. And that was their first month on TikTok, too. So >> dude, how many knives did you have to

sell to sell,000? >> It was a lot. The upstairs was intended to be kind of like an office originally. And I guess it still kind of is, but mostly just honestly trying to maximize my square footage. >> Yeah. >> To me, this is more of like the fashion stuff. >> Right. Right. That's what that's what it's turned into for sure. >> So, show us like what are some of the fashion stuff that you sell? >> Burle's recently on TikTok and been doing really well with them. So, I have

quite a bit of their stuff. This is Sarah. >> Sarah's wrapping presents. Sarah makes this place look nice and keeps me organized. >> Wait, is Sarah wrapping presents for Tik Tok shop? >> No. Um, she's helping me wrap presents for Christmas. >> Okay, nice. And so you you work here in in the office like from day to day. >> Yeah. >> That's awesome. How long have you been like working here? >> Uh well I just started in October. >> Oh wow. And how have you been liking

doing the whole Tik Tok shop thing? >> I love it. I get to play with things >> all [laughter] day. It's so fun. That's amazing. So how many employees do you have right now? >> Just one. That's her. >> Just one employee to do the numbers that you're doing. You just have one employee. Wow. >> And just recently. So >> that's got to be like the most [laughter] profitable business ever. That's crazy. How much does something like this go for?

>> Pretty much everything here is around 100 bucks. Good quality stuff. That's actually a brand out of Texas, too. >> Wow. And this is stuff that you actually enjoy. >> Yeah. Yeah. I was a customer of theirs before they came on TikTok. So, I was excited to see them come on board. >> And so, you stick with more of like the like country wear or >> I guess because that's kind of what I wear. Um, recently Boot Barn also got on TikTok. So, >> all the jeans over there in the

cabinets, those are all >> They Boot Barn sent you all that. >> Uh-huh. And >> they have two shops, one Boot Barn and one country. >> No way. tell us about like all the like all this stuff right here. >> Um, so most of it is also all Tik Tok, you know. Um, I got some of the knives in there. I try to keep some of the ones my best sellers, jeans and stuff in here. The Lost Remedies kit and the books up there. Those hold a close place to my heart because that's how I started

TikTok was doing all those books just in that one square. And honestly, only like six of them in that square used to be my only products for a long time. >> Show us some of the awards. I feel like we need to have those for the podcast actually. Yeah, that's cool. So, this one was from Tik Tok. It's uh electronic [snorts] office and books rising star award. >> A rising star. That must have been early on, right? >> Yeah, it was uh they did a summit event. >> Beginning of 2021,

>> California, right? Peach area. >> Mhm. So, Top Dawn, this one was for It doesn't have anything specific on here, but I was one of Topdon's biggest creators in Q4 of last year. This one was for Vivore for the same time. >> Have you shown these on TikTok at all? >> Yeah, we're the first ones showing. Wow. >> CC Tools. >> What? >> Yeah. That was when my other account was called Holistic. >> That is crazy. All the awards are nuts. This is something that you purchased

recently? >> I did. >> This is a huge accomplishment for you. >> It was. I uh this was the first thing I did as like a treat for myself since I started Tik Tok. >> I was going to say like you're so profitable and I feel like even this for you is pretty humble cuz you could have went for the Lambo. You could have went for [laughter] the >> Yeah. I wanted something that to where well one I wanted it to be at a price point to where I didn't feel guilty about buying it.

>> Um >> and two to where I could drive it and have fun and not worry about it, you know? Like >> is that still something that you worry about is like feeling guilty for like >> spending even though you're bringing in so much money. >> Yeah. >> Wow. It's where, you know, we've all come from a certain place and gone through certain things and >> for sure >> and spending money is not I spend it a lot on reinvesting in myself in here and and doing it, but um

>> something just flatout fun like this cuz I have a truck too, you know. This is just a toy. >> Um >> Got it. Got it. >> That's not easy to spend on. >> The big winners up here currently dominating Tik Tok shop. How did you first get involved with Shark and Ninja and how did it take over? I actually I I started with QVC and they had a lot of Shark Ninja products. Um and one of my buddies that's a creator, Tai, he's one of one of the top creators on the top

creator on TikTok right now. Um he was doing a lot of the Shark Ninja stuff and um we actually developed a really good relationship with the team that runs the Shark Ninja brand. Um and I feel like that gives us an advantage um because he communicates everything with us. We know when ad spin's happening. We know what products are coming out. he tells us beforehand. And so we developed a I think these days a really good relationship with your sellers goes a long way. Um especially with products

that sell out all the time. Shark Ninja has become a giant great case study for any company getting onto TikTok is the model that Shark Ninja has used >> 100%. >> Each one of these also has products in it. Um and everything you see typically is, you know, from the hat rack to the hats. Um you know, this is the new DJI company, by the way. their drones. >> Oh, no way. >> Yep. Um, we got speakers, Yuthi lights. >> So, a lot of these companies, are you hitting them up first or they're hitting

you up first? >> It's these days they're hitting me up first a lot. Um, unless I still constantly am looking for products on TikTok, you know, new products to do. Um, but these days I get a lot of requests. This is a company out of the US that made these lever rack. I tried a bunch of different methods before to keep everything organized. They're expensive. Um, but it's definitely the best purchase I've made since building the shop. >> It makes life a whole lot easier.

>> See, we got some supplements in there and things. >> Yeah, we got, you know, supplements on this side, hair products on this side. >> Um, we got sentiment oil air diffuser stuff over here. >> Oh my goodness. >> So, there's also five tuppers up there full of them, but these are all >> five. >> Yeah. Here, I can move this ladder out of the way. >> Are you the biggest seller of Hey Dudes? >> Not the biggest. >> I think you were the first one that I

saw do it, though. not the biggest because there are some some folks that like dedicate their account to just >> stuff like that. Um, but I have done very well with Hey Dudes. What's nice about Hey Dudes is they're constantly coming out with new ones. It's always a new product and a lot of the customers are repeat buyers. >> Once they buy one, you know, they come out with a new one that they like, they they'll also buy that. >> We got all the bags up here, too.

>> All the bags. Yeah. All different brands off uh Tik Tok. I've leather ones over here. That was a that was a no-name company on TikTok. They had just came on and I saw the bag and it was one of those things. I I scroll shop a lot and if something catches my eye while I'm scrolling, I'm like, what caught my eye about it? Right? Like the same way you try to make content, I feel like. And so if something catches my eye while I'm scrolling, I try to ask myself, can I use that whatever caught my eye into a

video? The same way. >> So you're just constantly thinking about it. you're so passionate about it and you like have that like they call it like a drop shipper eye, the drop shipping community. This is more like a Tik Tok shopper, >> right? [laughter] So over there, that rack is mostly like home related stuff. This over here is all kind of tools related. >> So you got all your Fantic stuff there. Ratchet wrench sets here. Yeah, it's >> Look, it really looks like a store. Like

you can just go out and pick what you want. >> We joke I'm like Bed Bath and Beyond, >> dude. That's nuts. >> So you got Oh wow. >> Propane torches. >> Propane torch. Yeah, I sell a ton of those propane torches. >> Oh my. Do you use it? Like you turn on the propane? >> Yeah, I turn them on. There's a lot of big brands in here, too. You know, there's Renegade Care. That one's Chemical Chemical Guys down there, >> you know. So, a lot of the the major

major brands on here. >> At what point is it like have you ever gotten a violation for like a blowtorrch or like for a knife or anything? >> I have not for those, but I have gotten violations for other things. Um, >> do you feel like have you ever felt like it age restricts? It it probably does, but I'll say this, the age group that you want to stay away from the most is the 18 through 24 anyway. So, you know, if it age restricts it, then I'm I'm I have no problem with that. Two of my

major brands here, NOCO and Rhino. >> So sick. All the Rhino straps. >> How How long have you worked with Rhino for? >> Rhino's been a full year. Um, and I'll say this, until this year, I didn't do very well with the straps. I always did well with the like trailer hitches and kinetic recovery ropes. The straps is what they've always had the most inventory of and they have a ton of it. Um, >> so what's like what truck straps on a grand scheme of things like products,

commerce in general? >> I I think so. I think it's the same reason why a lot of the Shark Ninja products do well is because there's a very broad audience, right? Um, there's even if you don't have a truck, maybe you have an SUV, maybe you have a trailer in an SUV, like there's people constantly need to strap something down just in life, I feel like. And it's not something that they have to use all the time either. Um, and from someone who has used straps forever, most of the

time like you buy some and then you leave them out somewhere or you know like and you screw them up or you lose them. So it's one of those things that seems to be people are constantly kind of adding on to and buying. >> So okay, I know that this is really like this is your personality. All this is your personality, right? But like you've obviously had you're 1% of the 1enter, but you're attracting I feel like those your products are not stuff that people in LA or New York would buy, right?

>> It's like all of America, >> right? >> Do you feel like that has a lot to do with your success? >> I think it has a lot to do with my success, but I will say some of my biggest besides Texas, my second biggest audience is California. >> Really? >> Which is interesting. I It doesn't let us dive in much deeper, you know, besides age group and location. I mean, you have a lot of outdoors stuff in California, too, >> right? >> Wow. >> But yeah, it it's I think you broad, you

know, broad nets. >> I think that's if you get too niche specific, um I think I think there's plenty of customers out there, but to do it on this type of level, I think you have to stay pretty broad. >> And then Christmas trees. Christmas trees. >> You love Christmas trees. >> I love Christmas trees. >> What does something like this go for? And like what is your profit on this? [laughter] >> So, it's probably one of my worst sellers if I'm being honest.

>> Really? You just let you just love them. >> I love it. Well, I've always wanted to be like there's a lot of people that do really well with Christmas trees specifically on TikTok. A lot of live sellers do it. I think this tree goes for a couple hundred bucks and you make about 20% off it, so it's a good margin. And I do sell a handful, don't get me wrong, but it's nothing like ratchet straps. >> This right here, this caught my eye more than anything. >> Yes, that's a new product to Tik Tok

recently. >> They hit you up. You hit them up. What did like >> They hit me up. I I got a collab invite. Um Yeah, it's crazy, >> dude. That is sick. Um, and you you were asking me earlier what the most expensive this might be the most expensive one. >> What does this one go for? >> It's like 1,000 bucks on sale. I can't I think retail normally it's like 1,500. >> I I don't think I got approved. So, [laughter] >> well, you can come by here.

>> Thank you, bro. I appreciate that. >> But then Kinetic is one of my brands and Kinetic. >> Oh, >> they've been So, you sell the stuff out this fridge, too. Some >> Yeah, some of the products. Yeah. So, I do a lot of Connect videos right in front of this fridge, actually. Pulling them out. Yeah, cuz I know Black Rifle. They're local and then they're also on Tik Tok. >> Yep. Black Rifle as well. >> Okay. Now, the rest of this, what is all this right here?

>> So, some of it is actually from Tik Tok. There's some kids ride- on toys. That's That's a toy of mine. [laughter] >> That's a ride pro electric bike. But over here you have generators, electric coolers. There's some kitchen stuff over here. Knives. >> Generators on Tik Tok. >> Generators on Tik Tok. All of those are from Tik Tok. >> This is a whole different world. Golf clubs. Golf clubs are on Tik Tok. Yep. [laughter] >> What? >> 69 golf has been a really good seller

for me in Q4 this year. >> Dude, I feel like you are like the digital Bass Pro Shop. Like, [laughter] [clears throat] >> this is crazy. Well, man, thank you so much for giving us a studio tour. Is there anything else that you need to show us that we haven't looked at? >> Man, that's it. >> I feel like we I feel like we have a lot to cover in the podcast, guys.
