$20,000 in [music] commission. >> In commission >> commission. >> So, how much in sales did you do? >> $135,000. >> $135,000 in sales from your cell phone. How many of those Tik Toks did you do a month >> that uh that month? I probably made like three, no, maybe two. >> Two Tik Toks and you made $20,000. >> Yes. >> Welcome back to the number one social commerce podcast on the internet. Today I have with me Ashley. Ashley, welcome to the show.

>> Hi. Ashley, tell me a little bit about your journey. When I found you, you had like How many followers do you have on Tik Tok? >> Right now, I have over 800,000. >> Over 800,000 on Tik Tok. >> Yes. >> How did you get so many followers on Tik Tok? >> So, around 2024, I saw like a bunch of people posting nostalgic stuff like on Tik Tok and I just thought like I could do that and and so I started doing that. But the thing was like the first video I posted it blew up to a million views. Millions,

I'm sorry. And I was like, maybe I can make some money doing this. So, I started posting more and I started making uh more videos and I started getting popular really fast and it kind of just like like snowballed from there. >> Okay. So, you were getting really popular on Tik Tok. What was this like in 2020 or when was this? >> Oh, okay. So, I started Tik Tok initially when it was musically in 2018. >> That's crazy. >> Yeah. >> How old were you when you started?

>> Uh, >> in 2018? >> I think I was like 21. >> Okay. 21. >> 21. 21. >> You get on TikTok. You get on musically. >> Yes. >> And are you are you doing like the dances or >> No. [laughter] No. >> What are you doing on musically? >> I was making funny videos. Like I was making just like like those cringy like funny videos, you know, that people look back on these days. Like there was a video of like my like I crouched over and I put a a female shoe in one hand

and I put a male shoe in another hand and it was like a closeup of like the male and female shoe in the video and then like it looked like they were kissing cuz it was just showing the shoes and then I ran back and I was like, >> "Wait, were you the original one from for doing that? Cuz I seen that before." I wasn't but [laughter] >> but it did well. >> But I thought I saw it and I was like I want to do that. I was just doing it for fun. Like that was like the whole point.

I was just it was a hobby in the beginning, >> right? Okay. So you're doing Tik Tok, you're doing uh musically. It's a hobby. You're getting a lot of views. You're getting millions of views on musically. >> Yeah. So like initially when I started before even the cartoon stuff, I was already getting like views. Like I remember the first time I posted on musically like the first 3 months I gained over 100,000 followers. >> Over a 100,000 followers in three months.

>> Yes. >> Just posting comedy. >> Yeah. Just just like this fun little videos. >> So what do you feel like people were really um following you for? Just cuz they like to laugh and it was just it just went viral. [laughter] >> Yeah. >> That's crazy. Okay. So you have musically. At what point does it does it like transfer to Tik Tok? Do your followers transfer over? >> What do you mean? >> Like when Tik Tok came out to replace musically? >> Yeah. Yeah, it did.

>> Did you have to start over? >> No. >> Okay. >> Like it it literally just one day I woke up and it was Tik Tok and I was like, "Oh, okay." >> So one day you wake up and it's Tik Tok and then you're still making comedy skits. >> Yes. >> At the time. >> Yes. >> So are you monetizing from that? >> No. Like in the beginning I was just doing that for pure fun. I don't even know if there was any kind of monetization offers to musically in that

time, but I was just posting it because I liked it. Like my whole life I've always loved being in front of the camera and making videos, pictures, just like anything. Specifically comedy is what I like leaned over, leaned towards. >> Okay. So, you've always been like a creator at heart. >> Yes. >> And then Tik Tok comes out. At what point do you start making money from doing what you or have did you ever make money from the comedy skits? >> I did make money from the comedy skits,

but it wasn't from musically. I would take these videos and I would post them like on YouTube, on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat. But I started making money specifically on Snapchat because when I'd post these videos, I started getting a following really fast on Snapchat. And then people would message me and they were like, "Can you post my tag and just give me a shout out?" And I was like, "No." And they were like, "Okay, here's some money." And I was like, "Money?

Okay." The first person who ever offered me that proposal, I still can't even believe it to this day because like back then it was just so mind-blowing. It was $300 for a shout out and I posted it and he got followers and he was so happy. And I remember even thinking at that moment like I could do something with this. But uh yeah, I continued just like making fun videos, posting it on all the social medias, but like Tik Tok never really I'm sorry, musically never really paid me at the time. It was just more

like a hobby. >> So, at the time, did Snapchat have the monetization program? >> No. >> Okay. So, it was you were just doing shout outs. >> Yes. >> How many views were you getting on your snaps at that time? >> Oh gosh, I remember anywhere from like 30,000 to 150,000 >> on one like Snapchat >> on my stories. Yes. >> That's crazy. And was it So, the Snap program wasn't even in effect yet. You're making money from from shoutouts. >> Yeah. What was like the biggest month

that you did just charging for shoutouts? Like how much money could you make from that? >> Um, this was like 2018. I think the most I made from like just like selling promos I think was like I want to say $6 to $8,000. >> Wow. Just selling shoutouts. >> Yes. >> So you did a bunch of shout outs that month. But it's so easy, right? You just like post a video and then you tag them and then >> Yeah. And it it wasn't even a video. It was just a picture. They just send me

like like for example there was this one girl she makes content on like makeup and beauty and she wanted me to like post her to like get other girls who wanted makeup tutorials. So she'd send me a picture like it was mostly pictures of herself just like oh makeup tutorials or whatever and then I it'd take me three seconds and I get paid like a hundred bucks. >> That's crazy. So did you have a job at the time? >> No, I've I actually >> You've never had a job?

>> Yeah, >> me too. Like I actually technically I did have a job one time when I was 17, but it was only for like three days at the um Spirit Halloween. >> Okay. Okay. >> I don't know if that counts as a job, but that was the only job I've ever had in my life. >> So, you're kind of like me. I feel like I grew up with the whole social media thing. I did social media for 10 years. A lot of people were like, "Well, what about when you worked before?" But I

never had a job before. Glory to God. So, like I, you know, it's been a crazy journey. Uh so, okay, you're making money from Snapchat. You're making money there. From what? From that point, when do you get on Tik Tok? Tik Tok or when do you start like monetizing? >> Like like what do you mean as like a creator or as like an affiliate? >> Yeah, like an affiliate. Like when did you start Tik Tok shop affiliate? >> I started Tik Tok shop affiliate around like exactly 2020.

I want 2024. The beginning of 2024. What was your first product that you did? This is actually such an interesting like topic because the first product I ever promoted on Tik Tok shop I actually purchased with my own money. Like Tik Tok shop was like kind of like new and it was like rolling out a lot in the for you page and I didn't really care for it at the time. So I was like h scroll whatever. But there was this one ad that stuck out to me. It was a um awareness hoodie and it said you are enough.

>> I remember that one. And on the back it said to the person who's reading this, I don't remember exactly what it said, but it said like, "We want you to be here longer." I cried when I saw that ad and I was like, "I need this hoodie." Now, here's the thing. I don't buy clothes. I don't buy clothes. Like, I just don't do it. And I paid $30 for that hoodie. That was a lot of money. Like, cuz I just don't do that, you know? So, I bought it and I was like, "Oh, man. I love this

hoodie. It's so beautiful. It has like it it sets a good message. sends a good message, but what if I could like post this on Tik Tok and get my money back, you know? And so I I literally didn't even know what to do. Like I didn't know anything about Tik Tok shop. I didn't know anything about posting or anything. So I just typed in I tried to find the ad that made me want to buy it and I just copied it. I I took the audio and >> Oh, you took the audio? >> Yeah, it goes

>> Oh, like it was just like a like a song. >> The sound. The sound. No, no, not that audio. I was like, I'm trying to be brave. So, I used that audio, that song, and then I was just like showed my shirt, my hoodie. Then I turned around, showed the back of the hoodie, and then I looked back at the camera, smiled, tagged the product, posted it. When I tell you I was not aware or I didn't have a concept of how powerful Tik Tok affiliate marketing was, but when I posted that video, it

got 30 million views. >> 30 million on your first Tik Tok shop video. >> My first Tik Tok shop video I ever made. >> So, what are you thinking when you see that? [laughter] >> I was thinking like, where's the money? I didn't know like how to read like >> you didn't know how to check. >> I didn't I didn't know anything like about the dashboard or or where my money or anything. I just knew that people were commenting and viewing and they were like just bought it. Just bought

it. I love this. I just purchased it. And I was like, I don't I don't want to understand this. Like I was literally in the dark for like a month. >> Wow. And then when you checked your earnings, what did your earnings say? Do you remember? >> Oh gosh, it was so long ago. Um, I just remember that at that time Tik Tok had like a daily withdrawals. >> So, I just remember when I started getting paid, it said like you can choose to withdraw and I was like, "Oh, cool." And then like the first payment

was like a couple thousand dollar. I was like, "Okay." So, I clicked withdraw and then like the next day it was like a thousand. I was like, "Oh, cool. Withdraw." And then like every day for months, it was probably like I want to say two 200 to $1,000 every single day. >> Every day from that point on. >> Yes. >> How much money were you making before you started Tik Tok shop? >> Oh, you mean like uh affiliate? >> Yeah, before you started affiliate.

>> I was actually a content creator. So I would make like videos about conspiracies and like cartoons and stuff. That was generally what my page was before I started Tik Tok shop. So, I was initially making from like8 to $15,000 a month >> from the creativity program. >> No, not No, no, no. Not just from the creativity program. From the creativity program, it was like seven a month. >> Okay. >> That's a lot though. >> Yeah. >> From the creativity program. That's

crazy. >> The videos were good. I did some pretty crazy conspiracies on there. I made it on the news so many times from my conspiracies. >> What were your views looking like to make that much? >> Millions. Millions. >> Like average? Like what was like do you remember what your total for the month was? [snorts] >> Like what do you mean >> like your total amount of views? Like how many millions did you was like average? You were averaging >> uh >> to make that kind of money? I'm just

wondering. >> Oh, to make that kind of money? >> Yeah, cuz I I used to do like 80 million on my pranks when I did Tik Tok before [laughter] shot and I was not making anywhere close to that. >> Um I would say it was probably like five to seven million. Five to seven million views a month. >> Yeah. >> To make 7,000. >> Yes. >> That's crazy. You must have had a good payment. Like it must [laughter] have been a good CPM. >> It was great. It was like from what I

remember it was like a dollar or like a couple dollars per thousand views or something. >> So if you're making that much on the creativity program and you see like Well, I guess you started making a thousand a day, right, from Tik Tok shop. >> So then you're making like 20 to 30,000 a month. >> So yes. Yes. At the time I was. Yes. But the thing was, I didn't really care about Tik Tok shop at the time. And like my mind wasn't really at like affiliate marketing. I just wanted my $30 back.

And I wish I could go back in time and kick myself in the butt and just be like, why are you still making cartoon videos? Like, get on Tik Tok shop. Like, this is a good this is >> So, you didn't fully go over? >> No. No, not at all. Like literally, I posted that one video and I just that was it for months. I look back at myself and I just like why didn't I take advantage of that moment. Like it was just one video. That was it. One. If I could if I could go back in time, I would have made multiple

videos. >> But to be fair, you were making so much money from the creativity program. Like I don't like I I like that's crazy. 7 to 8,000 a month on creativity program is really good money. So you're like comfortable at that point with that. That's that's what you know. >> Yeah. >> And so so then at what point do you start taking Tik Tok shop affiliate serious? >> I started taking Tik Tok shop affiliate serious around like September this year. It's kind of late because I started in

the beginning of 2024. So I started taking it serious like literally a few months ago. But the reason was because I kept seeing these Tik Tok shop affiliates on my for you page like you need to get on Tik Tok shop and do this and do that. And I kept seeing it for months and I was like why is my page flooded with this stuff? Like I >> you were against it. Be honest. >> I didn't Yes. Cuz I didn't care. The reason was because people would say like I just made $50,000 a month on Tik Tok.

I'm like See, but I knew that they that money was possible because I did make like 20 $30,000 like maybe even more when my first video. But the thing was like I thought it was luck. I just thought I genuinely got lucky and it wasn't going to happen again. So I like people were saying they were consistently making it and I just didn't believe it. So I I ignored it. But after like after months of just seeing like like it was on my fork page for a really long time. It it just wasn't gonna leave.

Like it was telling me like I need to do this. >> You were like do not recommend. >> Yeah. Like literally. Yes. And it kept showing up on my page. But then like one day I made an ad. So initially I was doing Tik Tok shop for free stuff. >> Okay. [laughter] >> I just not bad. >> I mean it's not bad. I'd make the ad for it, but I just wanted free stuff. But um the thing was like I made an ad on this one product and it ended up making me like I think it was like

$5,000 $7,000 in a month. And then I was like, you know what? I could probably do what all those other people are saying on my for you page. Maybe they are telling the truth. Maybe I could actually do something with this cuz I wanted to get away from like cartoons. Not that I didn't like it. It was just it was a lot of work. >> Wait, hold on. When you say cartoons, were you animating? >> No. So, basically, I would make con I create conspiracies on cartoons, specifically what millennials like.

>> That's so cool. So, you do like Spongebob conspiracies and stuff. >> Yes. I've done so many viral Spongebob conspiracies. Yes, >> that's awesome. >> Yes, but I I was starting to like run out of ideas. Yeah, I was starting to run out of ideas. I'm like, "Oh, this is getting hard. Maybe I should like lean towards something else." I still do the cartoon videos and stuff, but I just wanted to just something different, you know? And so I, as I said, I made that

video about that product and it started making like $57,000 a month and I was like, maybe I could scale this. So I found this program. Um, it was called Life Prreneur. I think that's how I don't know how to pronounce it, but it was a in-person event where you learn how to do Tik Tok shop. And I was like, "Okay, if I want to take this serious, I got to like actually like learn about it because I really didn't know anything about it. Even though I was making a lot of money from it, I didn't really know

what I was doing. So, I went to the event. I learned with like people who've made like over $3 million in GMV and that next month when I came back from the event, $20,000 in commission. >> Wow. What did you learn from that event that was so special? >> I learned that if you make videos, you have to learn what like the kind of like buyer psychology. You have to learn like why people buy products. Like people aren't just buying like, "Oh, this is a cool hairbrush." You know what I mean?

There's people who need hair brushes with sensitive scalps and a wet brush is better for them. So, I've kind of just learned to tap into seller psychology and just get really, really good at that. And I've had viral products numerous times throughout those two years I was doing Tik Tok shop before I took it serious, but I didn't know how to scale. So, the teachers told me, "Hey, the next time you get a good product, I'm sorry, the next time you get a good viral video, rinse and

repeat. Make more. Do the same thing, just a little bit different. Make more and more and more." So, that's how I got the 7,000 to 20,000 the next month was just scaling. >> That's incredible. >> Yeah. >> And so, from then, like what is what has the income been looking like for you like every month? Like ballpark. Well, it in September before I went to the event, it was like five, seven. I I don't remember off the top of my head. Uh October was seven and that was the

actual event in October. November was 20 20,600 and then in December was 16. >> Wow, that's good. This was uh last month. >> Yes. >> And so what are your big products now that you're doing? I saw that you had like a phone thing that you're going into like HV with and stuff. [laughter] Oh my god, that video. >> I was like, wow, she's really going all out. >> Yeah, that was so embarrassing. >> I was like, this girl I was like, this girl's committed.

>> Yeah, I like I remember my husband was like, you're not going to wear that in public, are you? And I was like, I'm going to make that money. I'mma wear whatever I got to wear. >> So, what are your best products now and how do you sell them? >> Well, it's not that neck tripod. I don't know if you read the comments on that video. They ripped me to shreds in that vid. >> Yeah, but that's not a bad thing though. >> Yeah, but it didn't The video didn't

convert. I think I only sold like 60 of those. So, it for like five, six million views. It's not a lot. But that's not my viral product. >> I was like looking at your video and I was like 56 million views. Should I do this? Like [laughter] she's going to the HB down the street from me. Like I was like, I know where she's filming this at. >> Oh, that's so funny. No, it it did it didn't do that great. I don't recommend it. I got embarrassed and [laughter] that much.

>> That's one thing that a lot of people don't understand is like views do not equal sales. >> Absolutely. >> Cuz sometimes they can be watching for entertainment. >> Yes. Absolutely. Yes. And I I kind of learned too like that with that video. It was very entertaining, but cuz I think it was entertaining because not a lot of people would do that. So it I don't know. It just didn't really convert very well. But yeah, >> but what are your winners though? Now,

>> right now I have three different winners. About maybe four. The first one is cat toys. >> Cat toys. How do you promote cat toys? >> I don't talk at all. I don't say anything. I don't sell anything. I don't even put music. I literally just put a cat toy on the floor and let my cats just play with the toys and that's it. >> Wow. Yeah, that that uh the first video I actually made for that actually ended up getting like I want to say 16 million views. >> 16 just your cats playing.

>> Yeah, >> that's crazy. Oh my goodness. [laughter] Okay, so that's your first product. What What are your other products? >> Um it's this pink fluffy rug. I have a room at my house that's all pink because I love it and I've always wanted to have like a whole pink room. So, I got a pink rug and I made an ad and I was like, sorry, I'm just trying to remember. I I posted this video in the summer and it's still making me money. But, um, it was just like pink fluffy rug check. And

then I was just talking about the rug, how pretty it is, and I was like, "Look at my pink room. I got my pink rug, and everything is pink." And everyone like thought it was really pretty. But the hook is actually what ended up making that video so popular. The hook was pink fluffy rug. Check. But people heard pink effing rug. People were like, "I did not hear fluffy." >> And people were like, "Did she say fluffy? I don't know if I heard fluffy." >> So then you got people to comment.

>> Yes. People were commenting. They were like, "Fluffy? She did not say fluffy." And that's kind of how like the video got viral. So, I my second bestselling product is pink rugs. >> And then the third, what's your third? >> The third is nail polish. >> Okay. How do you sell nail polish? >> So, um it's gel. Nail polish. Gel. If you go to like a nail salon, you're looking at paying like $50 to get your nails painted with gel. But I found this

product that's around $30 and you get a hundred nail polishes for $30 and you just do it at your home. And so I was like, "This is awesome." Because this was a product I wanted genuinely for myself. So I knew that if I promoted this, there are definitely women that think the same way I do and they want something that's more affordable. So I made a video and I said I I don't know if you've ever watched any of my cartoon videos, but like in the beginning of all my cartoon vid cartoon videos, I go like

this. And so I did that with a nail polish and I was like 100 nail polish colors, all gel, less than the price of one trip to the nail salon. And that was like my hook and everybody got so excited about that. And then I just It wasn't even long. Like literally making one of those videos would take me like two minutes. >> Wow. >> Yeah. And >> go [laughter] ahead. And so I would just make like one video. It take me two minutes to record, edit, and post. And I could literally make

like 20 of them in just like an hour. It was really fast. It was really easy. And I remember there was this one point I posted like in one whole day I posted 20 of those videos and each of them got about 25,000 to half a million views. Like each of them it was weird. Like I've never seen so many views in just like one section like with 20 posts consistently. But I knew I was like, "Okay, rinse and repeat. Rinse and repeat." That's that's how you scale. That's what you got to do.

>> That's incredible. So how many videos do you do in a day? Like what does your dayto-day look like now waking up in the morning? >> So I try to aim for about five to 10 videos a day. But the reason is because I focus on more of top of funnels and middle ofunnel videos on that page. explain to us top of funnel, middleunnel. >> Okay, so bottom of funnel videos is like when you record a Tik Tok shop ad and it only takes like a couple minutes and then the middle funnels is like 10, 15,

30 minutes. Top of funnels can take up to like two hours. Like when I make those cat ads, those can take me up to two hours. >> Wow. You make it sound so easy though. You're like, I just put the toy there, my cats go for it. >> And it's true. It is easy. I I don't even like record on TikTok. I record with just like my regular phone camera and I'll just be like and my cat will be like just freaking out over the toy and I'll just like Yeah, >> you like the director. [laughter]

>> Yeah, pretty much. So, I mean like yeah, those those cat videos take me two hours and that's like the top of funnels, but it it the amount of videos I post a day just depends on the product that I'm posting because sometimes I could only push like two, three videos a day if it takes me a few hours, but sometimes I can post like 10, 20 videos a day if it's like 10, 15, 30 minutes. >> How many pages do you have? >> I currently only have two pages. >> Okay. So, one is for your main account

and then what do you do on the second page? The second page is my bottom of funnels account, but it hasn't really like made any money yet because I'm still learning how to do bottom of funnels. >> It takes a while. I was just talking to some guy about that today. I think that it like takes months to build up that library before they start. >> Bottom of funnels is not for the week >> cuz people Well, the thing is like a lot of people don't understand like I was like one of the first people to do it.

And when I would do it though, people wouldn't skip them because they'd never seen anything like that before. So, when I'm using my voice and stuff, like people had never seen anything like that. Um, and now they're just so like used to seeing it that like if it's not targeting the right person, they're if it's just your audience, they're just going to skip it, right? >> So, it's hard for those videos to get picked up. But when they do, >> that's when it's like, you know,

>> Yeah, >> it does pretty well. I would almost say like what if you used your top ofunnel account and then on your second account you only did comment replies, but you made it a bottom ofunnel video as a comment reply. That's a really good idea. I didn't even think about that. Yeah, I'll try that. >> Of course. So, okay. So, your day-to-day now it could take a couple hours. It could So, are you only doing Tik Tok shop now? >> Right now, Tik Tok shop is like I want

to say 80% of what I focus on. Yeah. >> Wow. And then where like where do you go from here? Like what are your what are your plans from here to continue to scale? I'm going to learn to master product research because one thing I did learn at that event lifereneur is that you know it's not just about like making products about stuff that you want but it's also really tapping into what is going viral or what people what's in high demand or what people really want you know because when I did Tik Tok shop

I just did it for stuff that I wanted so I was making like mid money but when I started like getting viral off the one product I did really like I kind I started getting more information and studying more about how Tik Tok shop actually worked, you know? >> 100%. >> And so, I'm sorry, what was the question again? >> Oh, I was just saying like what's the plans from here? >> The plan is to continue learning how to do product research and get better, improve, and you know, make more money.

I want I'm hoping this year, this is going to be my year to blow up on Tik Tok shop and really master it. Like, you have no idea how many hours I would spend just studying and studying and studying. It was exhausting. But I want this year to be like the big dogs. Like I want to be at the top top affiliates on Caladata. Like I want when people look at my face, they're like, "Oh, >> that's Ashley." >> Yeah. Exactly. >> It'll happen. It'll definitely happen.

>> Yes, it will. >> And you've already done incredible for yourself. So now, if there's somebody that's just starting out >> and they're where you were, what would you tell yourself from the beginning? What advice would you give them? >> Just start. Just start. Because I know a lot of people who have thought about doing Tik Tok shop and they over complicate the process. And it really doesn't need to be complicated. It wasn't like when I first started, I

literally didn't even know like how to understand the dashboard and nothing. I just recorded a video, tad the product, posted it. That was it. Just start. Yes, you can start a little bit uneducated. I was completely uneducated, but I still did it. Like, I feel like part of the reason a lot of people aren't where they want to be with literally anything is just because of execution. Just start. You can still study, post. You could still attend events, learn, post. You don't know what you're doing. You don't

know what product to pick. Pick something and post. Because once you start practicing on posting and you start creating content, you get better. You learn through experience. So, just start. That would be the only thing I would tell myself. Just start and then just keep going and be consistent with it too. >> Incredible. And then what's your what like what total GMV are you at right now? Do you know? >> I don't know right now, but um yeah, >> because you're probably doing like what

100k GMV every month. >> Well, I I started taking it serious around like September and I started getting it like actually money rolling around October, but um >> Well, if you're taking home 20,000, I mean, you got to be doing 100 at least. >> Yeah. No, I was I got a like 135 GMV. >> 135k GMV in one month. Wow, that's insane. And you've been a you've been pretty close every month to that. I feel like >> Yeah. No, >> since then. >> That's awesome.

>> Yeah, I'm very happy because I didn't really know that there was this much potential in Tik Tok shop. If somebody would have told me two years ago, hey, you can become rich doing this, I would have actually took action. I I didn't know how lucrative this industry is. Nobody really actually knows how how successful and rich you can be just doing this. And to me back then I didn't see it as anything at all. Just maybe like enough money to pay groceries or I don't know. I didn't know people were

like becoming millionaires from this. >> So is this the most money you've made in your create like creator career >> like in general? >> Yeah. >> No. >> No. No. [laughter] Um, no. >> So, you have So, you've done something that makes more money. >> Yeah. >> So, why Tik Tok shop then? >> Um, I do Tik Tok shop because I feel like it's a lot easier to scale than any other industry. And it's >> So, you have hope that it's going to be

bigger than >> everything else? >> Yes. But I feel like, and this is my opinion, I feel like Tik Tok shop is the fastest, easiest, and quickest way to making a bunch of money. And it's not that like I can't do that through content creating or other things, but I just feel like it's really, really, really easy to make a lot of money fast compared to everything else. And I've done a lot of things, a lot of different entrepreneurial things in the past 10 years. Incredible. Well, I mean, I think this

podcast offered so much value. I think that people are going to learn so much from it. Um, Ashley, is there anything that we didn't touch on or that you want to leave the people with? >> Um, I would say if you're somebody who's thinking about doing Tik Tok shop and there's something in the back of your head that's making you a little scared to do it, I would just say this. Jump in the water straight. It's kind of like when you jump in the water like a cannonball instead of just like acclimating. Just

jump in. Just do it. Don't be scared. Because I know a lot of people are very scared of trying new things, especially something that they don't know about. But I've learned that the fastest way to get good at something is to just start and just keep doing it. And don't don't get scared, you know? Don't get intimidated. Just do it. You can do it wrong. Do it messed up. Do it embarrassed. Do it looking goofy, but just do it and do it brave. There's a saying. It goes um

do it scared. I can't remember it. [laughter] I'm sorry. It said um do it scared because being scared and still doing it is the true meaning of bravery. So I would just say if anyone's watching this, just do it. Just do it. >> Incredible. Thank you so much, Ashley.
