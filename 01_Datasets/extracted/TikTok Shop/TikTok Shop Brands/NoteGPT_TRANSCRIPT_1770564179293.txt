In this video, I'm going to walk you through the most important growth strategy for e-commerce brands that I've seen in a long time. This playbook has been validated with tons of e-commerce giants doing tens of millions of dollars in sales every single year. A playbook that all the big brands know, but you may not. This is the fastest growing flywheel of almost every single successful brand and product on Tik Tok shop right now. And it's called super UGC. And at the heart of it is a method

I call viral looping. So today, I'm going to show you, what it is, how it works, and how brands are doing millions per year in sales, and a small secret trick I use with our clients to amplify their brand even more from it. Now, what is super UGC and viral looping? Think of one big massive wave of content going out at the exact same time from different creators on social media like Instagram, on Tik Tok, on YouTube shorts, or even Meta. With your brand or product at the center of it, one creator

going viral after the next, it creates a constant loop of fresh content and creatives for the consumer who's scrolling or searching for a solution like yours. Because of this wave, it literally gives your brand a massive omniresence on socials without you having to make a post or a single piece of content yourself. But what's crazy is this literally gives you way better ROI on your ads, lets you creative test for free, and it pretty much guarantees success for your brand. by leveraging thousands of creators and blasting out

all that content at once. So, let's break down how this works and why it's so different from what most brands do. Most brands do content like this. They do organic content. Think Poppy, for example. Their brand account is full of aesthetic content that drives home the vibe of the brand, the bright colors and the visuals of the brand. It most likely isn't going to drive any sales, but it's aesthetically pleasing. The second is the influencer content, and this is how it works. The brand signs a creator like

Alex Earl or Paris Hilton. They pay that influencer and the influencer goes and creates a post that the brand can be tagged in or go up on the account. But here's the problem. It's really just temporary and you're basically renting their audience. In most cases, the influencer may not know how to tell the story and ultimately that post can flop. We've all seen the Kardashians and other huge influencers who built empires off of this model. But that was when followers mattered. Small creators

couldn't even get in front of people because of the algorithm. So, brands had no choice but to pay the Kim Kardashians of the world, the traveler influencers, and all the bigname influencers out there. And this is literally one big gamble and no way to guarantee your results. And we all saw the one girl who had over 2 million followers and couldn't even sell one t-shirt to her entire audience. And what brands learned from this is that most of these influencers had really shallow audiences

and no real connection from follower to influencer. So, a new style of content entered the building to combat this. It was called usergenerated content, UGC. The brands caught on and realized paying 10,000, 50,000, even 100,000 for one post just isn't even worth it when you can't guarantee an ROI. So, they started paying normal people like you and I to create videos and then the brand would post those videos on their account and retain control. Tryons, unboxings, product review based videos. But there's

another problem here. It doesn't bring you new customers. It only engages your current customers even more. People don't want to buy from the influencer anymore or even honestly the brand. They want to buy from real people and that was how most brands went about their content. Organic which doesn't bring conversions influencers which had a horrible ROI and UGC but it still feels like an ad. So here's the solution. Super UGC and viral looping. This new shift came from one simple change. Tik

Tok recently changed their algorithm to an interestbased algorithm. And this made all the social platforms follow after. And this changed everything. When followers used to matter, now followers don't mean a thing. You could literally have zero followers on social media and go viral with a post and reach millions of people. So what does that mean? Well, brands got really smart and gave the control back to the microcreator. Instead of the brand posting on their account, the creator goes and posts

themselves on a smaller account. And this completely removes the video feeling like an ad. It eliminates the ROI concern and drives way more conversions because it's coming from a real person. And if you search a brand like David Protein on Tik Tok, you don't see thousands of David Protein brand videos. You see thousands of regular creators like you and I creating content about David Protein. And what David figured out is that they can use a platform like Tik Tok shop to attract thousands of creators on commissions and

educate them on how to create content for their brand. And David Protein makes sales on autopilot without lifting a single finger. Where a traditional UGC creator or influencer would cost thousands for maybe one or two videos, David Protein can sign up thousands of creators for the same price and have a literal wave of content going out, keeping the consumer in a viral loop of content over time. which is converting and turning all of them into paying customers. And that consumer every single day will see constant David

Protein videos going out from different people and different backgrounds. And they'll keep popping up on their for you page and feed from different accounts and creators. And that is the key. Brands like goalie, tabs, chocolate, grooms, and others have perfected this formula to a te. And this is the fastest way to create a marketing army on the back end of your brand. But here's a little golden nugget. When brands do have a post that does really good with all of these creators, just put some

paid ad dollars behind it and it will do even better. Meaning, you are quite literally creative testing for free with creators and getting paid as a founder to do so and then leveraging those videos and ads. So, let's take a look at a real life example on how you can execute this for your brand. Specifically, I'm going to use David Protein again here as an example. David Protein Bars have literally done over $150 million in sales doing exactly this. They're everywhere on social media

and I want to show you in real time how it works. So, as you can see, David Protein is on Tik Tok shop. They're getting tens of thousands of sales on their product. And if we just go to Tik Tok and we search up David Protein, you can literally see hundreds if not thousands of creators posting about their product. And what they're doing is they're getting these people as affiliates to make these videos. And what you'll notice here is some of these say paid partnership. Boom. That means

that they're leveraging that creator to make content for them. And not only that, that means they're also pushing ad dollars behind it because they're getting hundreds of creators to essentially test the videos out. And then once they see which ones are working, they're then amplifying ad dollars behind those through a Tik Tok J&D Max campaign. So essentially, you're getting testing done for free. And then you're taking those videos and leveraging them in paid ads to amplify

the sales even more, guaranteeing that you're going to get a much higher ROI. And the creator, they get paid on the affiliate side, making commissions. And then on the brand side, they're making a ton of money because they're adding more paid dollars behind it, averaging anywhere between three to 6x ROI. So that way they can scale profitably and not have to create content themselves. So let's check out one of the videos. >> Change fitness forever. This protein bar is currently the highest protein to

calorie ratio bar on the market. It's 28 g of protein for only 100. >> So So this is a simple video. They sent the product to the crater. In some cases, the creator doesn't even have the product and they're using a screen share where they're just showing the protein bars, breaking down the product throughout the video, going over the features, benefits, educating individuals on David Protein drives more views, and then if the video works, David Protein is then taking this video

and running it as a paid ad in a Tik Tok JV Max campaign to amplify view volume and conversions and get more sales based off of every creator that performs. And the really savvy brands take those videos and migrate them to Meta so they never have to worry about creating content ever again. And you can see this with pretty much every big brand out there. If we search up another brand like Grunes, you can quite literally see all of these videos of people making breakdowns. Here I have myself as well where I break down

their video. But these are the affiliates and paid partners that we can see here where they're making content around the product going over different problem and solutionbased videos. This creator posted didn't get very many engagements. Well, probably didn't work that well, but this creator posted did really well. So what did Gruns do? They amplified it with paid ad dollars. And you'll see this again and again over and over throughout the best performing creators. So, the goal isn't just to

send out product to anyone and everyone. It's to find the right creators, get them to make the content, and then once you see some subtle signs of success, maybe $500 in sales, $1,000 in sales, well, that's where you move the money. You take the ad dollars, put it behind the videos, now you're generating 10, $20,000 off of one single creator's video. And you can try this with any big brand you know. Just go ahead and search them, and you'll see similar strategies working across the board. And I truly

believe this is going to be the new way of growing your brand. But here's what's shocking. Only a few of these brands are really forward-thinking brands that are doing this right now. And so many others haven't even dug across the surface yet. And my clients like Kira Eyewear, Better Life Labs, and Vegan Live Moss are doing this right now and are seeing explosive sales in crazy numbers. And I say this to all of you to show you the massive amount of opportunity here that is being missed and completely untapped. Now,

just like anything, what is the downside to using this strategy? Well, with traditional content strategy, the downsides are poor ROI, shallow audiences, or maybe not even real audiences at all. And there's tons of guesswork, and super inconsistent results. But with Super UGC, I don't see many downsides. Super UGC has huge ROIs, micro creators who are pushing your product for you with authentic viewers, creators that have a viewer to individual connection ratio, and no guesswork, really consistent results,

and even better once you put paid ad spend behind it. and are some of the highest performing videos that you can leverage on other platforms as well. Here's literally step by step how I'd set this up for a brand like Orca Energy so you can follow along and set it up for your own brand. So, the first thing you're going to do is you're going to get activated on Tik Tok shop and then you're going to run an AI bot to be able to send out thousands of invites to these different creators. This is where

you're going to source all of the content so that way you can be able to leverage that later on for paid ads. And the first step of this process is, well, you want to pick a category that fits your audience. So, if you're in the space of water, you're going to find people who are into healthy alternatives and clean energy. So, what you would do is you would build this category, send out the thousands of invites to these creators, and then out of those thousand, we're going to look at every

creator and see who's generating the most views on average per video, who's the most authentic, who aligns with our brand, and who's done not only the fewest collabs, but has also generated the most amount of money per view. because this ensures that we get a good ROI every time we ship out our product to them, we'll set commissions around 20 to 25%. And then once we start shipping out the products and we start receiving the videos, we're going to analyze and see which videos do best. Not every

creator is going to be a grand slam. So, we need to pay close attention to the creators that do 500 in sales, 1,000 in sales, maybe one goes viral and does 10,000 in sales. Well, once we start seeing some of those orders start to come through, we're going to take that video and launch it into what we call a Tik Tok GMBB Max ad campaign. And this is where you can leverage those videos, make them look organic, and be able to amplify with paid ad dollars and set a target ROI of a 3 to 6x. This ensures

that we can spend thousands of dollars a day profitably and be able to amplify the creators we're working with and get more views and orders. The next step from there is just rotating those best performing creatives because that is our testing pool for finding out what works and leveraging it on meta ads and scaling it even further. This is a perpetual flywheel that if done right can allow you to scale to 50, 100K, even 300K months on Tik Tok shop. So, if you want to check out that tool and also get

up to $6,000 in Tik Tok ad credits, then I've linked both of those below this video. So that way you can get activated with the affiliate bot and also be able to get free ad spend to put behind these creators that start posting for you. That way you can start taking immediate action from this video. So be sure to play this back multiple times so that way you fully understand every step that you need to take. And by using this viral looping UGC strategy, it's the biggest opportunity I've seen for brands

in a long time. And so many brands are not utilizing it. And the ones that are, they're crushing the competition. So, if you like the video on building a UC army for yourself, then you'll love this one that I picked out for you on the five viral ad formats that you can start using with your creators in this very next video.
