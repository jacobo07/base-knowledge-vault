Meta's Andromeda update made one thing very obvious. If you want consistent Meta performance, then you need creative diversity. And most brands are mistaking creative diversity for changing a hook here and there or changing the copy. My name is Fraser. I'm the founder of Fraggle, and we help DTOC brands across the US and Europe scale with performance ad creative. In today's video, I'm going to be breaking down what creative diversity actually is, how Meta deals with creative diversity with the new

Andromeda update, and most importantly, the systems that we use at Fraggle to ensure that we get the best results for our clients in this new age of advertising. All right, let's get things started, shall we? The easiest way to think about the Andromeda update is instead of Meta thinking who should I show this ad to, they're saying which version of this ad should I show to this person. So if you give Meta five ads, they're all basically the same thing. Maybe a couple of copy changes, maybe a

different vibe, you're giving the system very little option in what to deliver to people. [music] And so they end up seeing the same ads all the time, therefore impacting your performance. I've been preaching creative diversity and that creative is your targeting for a very long time. And it's only now that the algorithms have kind of got up to date with that. And that's why creative diversity matters more this year than it did even last year. And this is why at Fraggle, we pride ourselves on creative

diversity, being able to deliver brands, everything from a low-fi static all the way to a high production product ad because different people respond to different ads. And now the meta algorithm is built for just that. So at its core, created diversity is just about filling your account with different ads. Different ads that resonate with different customer bases so that Meta knows that it can deliver these different ads to these different people. They're essentially stopping people from posting the same ad with a

different 2C hook with a changing caption to almost game the system. So to keep things simple, we think of creative diversity in like four main levers. The first one is persona. Same product, different buyer. For example, if we're working with one of our clients, Humantra, two of their core personas, one of them being athletes, runners, people that need hydration to operate at the highest efficiency. Number two is office workers, people that often forget to drink water and so they get headaches

during the day and they feel rough. That's two different personas that you can make ads for, but the same product. And the next lever is messaging. This is basically a different reason for someone to buy your product. Going back to the humantra example, I mentioned that athletes buy it so that they can operate at peak performance. It helps them stay hydrated when they're running. That is a persona and a messaging combined. The third lever is the hook. How you are attracting attention within the first 3

seconds. There's so many different types of hooks. I've made multiple videos on this exact channel about different hooks that you can use. We've got visual hooks, we've got audible hooks, we've got copy hooks, we've got bold claims, we've got visual demos. so many different ways that you can hook in a user into your ad. It's all about pulling people away from the scroll, away from their feed that's filled with friends and families and influencers. Give that person a reason to stop and

watch an advertisement. And the fourth lever is the format. This could be a UGC format. It could be a founder video. It could be a static, a carousel, a product demo video. Think of this as the wrapper that you're putting around your persona, your messaging, and your hook. If you think of creative diversity like these building blocks, it will very quickly help you get into the mindset of how you can change one messaging and use a different format and make a different ad. At its core, so many ads are

basically the same, but the format might be different or the persona might be different. And in Meta's eyes, that's a different ad. But with this new Andromeda update, we normally need to change all of these for it to be counted as a different ad. You can't just change, you know, the text on a hook and expect that to be created diversity because it's well, it's not. Now, before we get into how to iterate and how to actually build created diversity in your account, why don't you give this video a

cheeky little like and if you happen to run a DTC brand, you can scan the QR code on the screen to work with my agency and we can do all of this for you. So here is how we like to build ads at Fraggle and iterate. So let's break this into two sections. The first one is actually building the ad units. So let's use the Humantra example that we spoke about before. Let's say the persona is athletes. The messaging is that Humantra helps you deliver peak performance during long runs such as you know

marathons. So the creative strategist has worked those two things out. They know the messaging and they know the persona. So the next thing I tell them to look at is the format. How are we going to deliver this ad? A couple of ways that you can do this. The first one is by using historic data. Going inside your ad account, seeing what formats perform best. Again, when you have a history of creative diversity, this is much easier. But when you don't, you kind of just have to throw a load of stuff at the wall and see what sticks.

So, if you work with an agency like mine, then you might have more creative diversity options available to you than other agencies. For example, the ones that only make UGC or static ads. We have the ability to do everything from high production podcast ads all the way down to those like lowerfi content styles. So let's say that the podcast format for example is one that performs really well historically for humantra. Well that is going to give our creative strategist a couple of options. We could

do a expert ad for example where a marathon runner is being interviewed by someone about how they stay hydrated during long runs. It could be two marathon runners talking and exchanging tips on again how they manage to keep on running and stay hydrated throughout, you know, 4hour long run. It's the same messaging. It's the same persona. It's just a different format and idea. So, let's say that we went ahead and we made that video. We might find out that the podcast format just wasn't right for

that. So, what we could do is go back to the drawing board and just change the format. Perhaps a UGC testimonial video. Again, we have someone on a run documenting their journey, showing them make Q mantra and showing them drinking it on the run. Same messaging, same persona, different format. And then within that mix, we have the hook, remember, as well. So for the hook, for example, we could take like a really dramatic part of that podcast ad and put it at the start of them saying, you know, how this changed their life or

whatever or how this simple hack altered their marathon running forever. But for the UGC example, maybe we'll do a hook which is more gathered towards like UGC. Maybe it's someone pouring a sache on their face or pouring water over their face, something to really hook people in. Again, say it with me now. Same persona, same messaging, different format. And then to achieve creative diversity across the entire account, now we just switch things up completely. Different persona, different messaging,

different format. Do you see where we're going? It's simply not enough anymore to basically run the same ads with the same script, same footage, same creators over and over again with a different hook. Meta knows that people use this trick to game the system. So, they don't want you to do it anymore. You can still use the same script, but change the creator, change the location, change the format. There's actually been so many ad accounts that I've been in where they use this exact hook. They mainly test

the script. So, every single ad will have a different script, but the same format. When they find a winning script, they then dive into that further and make that script into different formats. Maybe they'll do a mashup UGC and they'll do a testimonial UGC with different creators and then they might even do like a voice over VSSL because they know that script works. So now they're just creating diversity with the format. This is actually why I think iterating on creative the same way that

we did 2 years ago simply won't be a thing this year. No longer can we go into an ad account, just change the hook and expect to see completely different performance. It was a really simple win a couple of years ago and could boost performance. And don't get me wrong, it still does work sometimes, but the majority it's not because when you find a winning angle, instead of recreating the ad 10 different times, you want to expand on that angle, go a bit deeper, change the format. So the system,

instead of getting one high-quality option, it's getting five or six highquality options to then choose to serve to the relevant person. And like I said, different people react to different creative. There might be a batch of people that really love UGC demo videos. There might be a batch of people that really love podcast ads, but they're in the same persona as the UGC people. Listen, if there's one thing that you need to take away from this video, it's that Andromeda doesn't

reward more ads. Creative volume, I hate to say it, is not the answer. Instead, it rewards intentional variety. So, that means that if you want better performance or meta, you need to stop testing incremental small changes and start doing big swings and making better creative. And listen, if this sounds like a whole lot of too much for you to think about and you happen to spend over 70,000 on paid media, just scan the QR code on the screen or click the link in the description and you can apply to
