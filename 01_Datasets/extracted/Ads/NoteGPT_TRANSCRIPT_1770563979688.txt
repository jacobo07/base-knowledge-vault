When I say I make AIGC ads, most people expect me to show them something like this. >> Black girl vitamins boost energy, support healthy hair and skin, and keep your immune system strong. >> The problem is this video is boring. You aren't getting any sales if you post something like this. Now, compare it to this AIGC video I just made. >> Throw all your supplements in the trash because [snorts] I found one pill that can help you sleep like a baby, train like an animal, and have limitless

energy. That video was directly inspired from this Tik Tok which just got 2 million views. In this video, I'm going to show you exactly how you can turn some of the most viral Tik Tok shop and meta ads [music] videos into your own AIGC vids which you can post for your own brand or even for other brands as a Tik Tok shop affiliate or AI ad agency. I'll go through the entire five-step method 7, 8, and 9 figure companies are using to make their realistic AI UGC videos from complete scratch, and it

will all be done in less than 10 minutes. Okay, let's get into it. Step one is finding a winning creative to clone. A mentor once told me, "Great artists steal." And the fastest way to make a profitable video is to take as many elements as possible from an already profitable vid. You can use the meta ads library to already find videos from your competitor if you have an established brand and know who you're competing with. Or you can use what I prefer, Fastmos, to find winning

creatives for a bunch of different products. Fastmos shows you exactly what Tik Tok shot videos are working. And a lot of times these products are actually drop shipped. Also, if the video is working through Tik Tok organic, that's the perfect sign it's going to be a winning creative. After scrolling through Fast Moss, I found this magnesium glycinate product which is selling well. And then I scrolled through the viral videos list and found this video with 2 million views. This is the exact video I'm going to download

and use as inspiration for my AIUGC video I'm going to make. Okay, so whether you use the meta ads library, Fastmos, or just scroll through Tik Tok or Instagram, once you've got your creative, the next step is to make the AIUGC video. And this is the secret source. The tool we are going to be using is Max Fusion AI. As in my opinion, having tested loads of different AI UGC tools, it is the best one on the market. In fact, I'll link down below MaxFusion AI in the description and in the pin comments. You

can check it out, sign up, and follow along with me as we [music] make this viral AI UGC ad. Okay, so once you sign up, you'll be brought to the Max Fusion dashboard. You want to click new project and then copy lab in the top right corner. This is a game-changing feature because what this allows you to do is upload any video and MaxFusion AI will be able to transcribe the video for you and then you can clone that vid. This is exactly where I'm going to upload the viral Tik Tok video that got 2 million

views. Once the video is uploaded, you can see the extracted transcript on the right hand side. Slightly later in this video, I'm going to show you exactly how we're going to write original viral script. So stay tuned for that. In the meantime, let's click the extract frames button. This is a really cool feature because what we can do is take screenshots from the video that we are going to clone for our AIUGC ad. So, a good rule of thumb is to extract a frame each time the scene changes. For this

particular video, the scene doesn't change an awful lot, but every now and then, new stuff appears on the screen. Then, when we click save frames, all of the stills will appear along the bottom of the page. This is where Max Fusion AI is so elite compared to other AI UGC tools. Watch this. What you can do on one of the frames is click the three buttons and then click banana clone and Max Fusion AI will create a clone of that still image. So what I suggest is select one of the pictures where your

character is prominently shown because Max Fusion AI will create another version of that character but it be completely original. Okay, so our AI UGC character is made and look how similar he looks to the original person. It's almost a splitting image but it's 100% original with AI. I mean, I've used Max Fusion AI for months now, and I'm still in awe of this technology because the fact you're able to basically replicate videos of people, but it's 100% original, no copyright infringement. I

mean, the possibilities are endless. You can do this for celebrities if you wanted to. Okay, we've got our character for the scenes, but we still need a script for them to say, and this is where we're going to use VLOOKU. I'm not always a fan of using AI to write scripts for you as it can sound too robotic. But where Vlo AI is different is it can train clawed AI and chat GPT based on trending data and already given examples. So within Verolo, I did an orbit search on magnesium to pull in the

most trending videos around that topic. That data will now be used to influence exactly what Claude AI outputs. So Verlo's analyze all the videos to do with magnesium to tell me exactly [music] what's driving engagement and it will plug that data into the AI model. Alongside this, I also provided the original Tik Tok video that we wanted to clone and I also provided a YouTube video example of what winning Tik Tok script should look like from this YouTuber. So all of this information plugged into claude 4.5 set will give me

targeted outputs with trained AI. Okay. So based on the Volo AI output, I've shortened the script and this is what it's going to look like with the parts in parentheses being the B-roll to generate. Okay. Let's go back to Max Fusion AI so we can bring this vision to life. So on the image tab in Max Fusion, we're going to drag our image into the box at the bottom and then select Nano Banana Pro and describe exactly what we want our character to do in each of the B-roll scenes. Please do not over

complicate this. just describe what the person is going to be doing in the B-roll scenes. We're going to turn these images into videos. So, all our images are generated. We're now going to click the video tab along the top and then select videos as the option. The model we're going to choose is Cling 2.6 as in my opinion it is the best on the market right now. One by one, we're going to select our reference images and then write in the prompt exactly how the video is going to turn out. Now, be

aware, make sure the video is 9x6 as that is what is needed for short form content. And also make sure it's just 5 seconds as there's no point burning credits unnecessarily, especially when B-roll should not be longer than 5 seconds. Anyway, I then do this one by one to generate each of the B-roll scenes. So, the B-roll is generated and as you can see, it looks absolutely awesome. We've got our character lifting weights in the gym, typing away his computer, it still amazes me how we've

got this same character in different environments, wearing different clothes, but it's still exactly the same person. This is one of the reasons why I stick to Max Fusion AI, because having tested other AI UGC tools, it just doesn't live up to the same caliber. Okay, so we've got the B-roll for the scenes, but we still need the talking head part when our character is actually explaining what's going on. And the first part to that is having the right voice. So, I've actually designed my own voice for the

character and then plugged in the API key to Max Fusion AI where it says integrations. I'd recommend this because you can have more customizability about how the voice sounds, but you can also just select one of the voices on Max Fusion should you want to. Now, to do the talking head videos, where it says videos on the left hand side, you actually want to change this to RZ. Now, Max Fusion has two models, RZ and Lucid. Riz was their original model which is super expressive. So your character is

going to be very animated. Whereas Lucid is still expressive but it's a bit more reserved and stable. Because normal UGC is very robotic and boring. It's heavily recommended to use one of these two models so your character has more life, is more animated and expressive in the way they talk. So I'm going to select the initial frame for the scene and the correct voice. And then I'm going to paste my script into Max Fusion. And then importantly, we're going to click this magical button, enable emotion

tags. These purple tags that appear will instruct the AI how we want the character to express what they're saying. Whether we want them to be moody, energetic, shy, etc. This adds life to the video rather than just having a boring, monotonous tone. So, the plan is to make two talking head videos. One for the character in the bedroom at the start and then the second one for the character in the kitchen talking about the benefits of the product. And we're going to generate each of those scenes separately. One

using RZ and the other using Lucid. Okay. So, once that's generated, we have all the components for our AIUGC video. We now need to edit it all together. And for that, I recommend Cap Cut. Once you've opened up Cap Cut to a new project, I'd recommend importing all of your files and then drag all of the talking head videos into the timeline in order. Spend some time to cut out any dead space where the character is not talking whatsoever, as you want to keep the video very tight and not waste any

time. Then I layer the B-roll on top of the video at the relevant moments. And then finally, I add some captions to the video using Cap Cut's auto caption feature. Here's the final video that we created. Throw all your supplements in the trash because I found one pill that can help you sleep like a baby, train like an animal, and have limitless energy to achieve all these things. Depends on which magnesium you take. And that's exactly why I take this magnesium complex right here, because it has eight

forms of magnesium in it. And there's 1,000 mg, so it's going to be very strong, very effective. You guys are going to feel those benefits within 24 to 48 hours. >> As you can see, a fantastic AIGC video. And in fact, I posted that exact video on X the other day and someone DM' me wanting me to make 100 AI UGC creatives for their established e-commerce brand. So with that one video, I can launch an AI UGC ad agency and that client would be worth 5 figures a month. That is the power of expressive realistic AI UGC

content. Check out Max Fusion down below in the description and the pin comments. You can make your own viral AI UGC ads. And if you want the entire workflow I use to make AI UGC videos a toz, DM me on Instagram. the word UGC and I'll send it over to you. And if you are looking to start your own brand or you're a Tik Tok shop affiliate and not sure what products to market, check out the video right beside me as I went through Fastmos in depth to show you exactly what products you should be selling and

how to spot winning videos to replicate. I'll see you right there.
