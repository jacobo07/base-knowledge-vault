# FOREPLAY CREATIVE INTELLIGENCE LAYER — TM-AdsOS

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Authority:** DS-001 Section 6 (Creative Research) | CONSTITUTION.md v1.0
**Scope:** All creative research, competitor analysis, and ad breakdown operations within TM-AdsOS.

---

## 1. Purpose

This layer governs how external creative intelligence (competitor ad libraries, winning ad patterns, format/hook analysis) is sourced, processed, and applied within the system. It operationalizes DS-001's Creative Research requirement (Section 6) and Ad Breakdown Methodology.

---

## 2. Creative Intelligence Sources

| Source | Type | Usage |
|--------|------|-------|
| Meta Ad Library | Competitor ads | Pattern extraction, format identification, hook analysis |
| TikTok Creative Center | Competitor ads | Trend identification, format effectiveness by niche |
| Foreplay (or equivalent tool) | Saved ads, swipe files | Curated winning patterns, organized by niche/angle/format |
| Own account winners | Historical performance | Iteration basis, proven patterns |

---

## 3. Integration Rules

### 3.1 — No Blind Copying (DS-001 Forbidden Optimization #9)

Competitor ads MUST be analyzed through the Ad Breakdown Methodology (DS-001 Section 6) before any inspired concept is produced.

Required per competitor ad referenced:
- Scene-by-scene breakdown
- Hook analysis (first 3 seconds)
- Buying triggers identified
- Visual proof elements cataloged
- Credibility elements cataloged
- Format classified
- Hypothesized success drivers documented

### 3.2 — Research Citation Requirement

Every creative brief generated by Agent 2 MUST cite at least one creative research finding. The citation format:

```
Research basis: [Source type] — [Specific finding]
Example: "Competitor analysis — Top-performing UGC ads in skincare niche use before/after visual proof within first 5 seconds"
```

### 3.3 — V1 Limitation

In V1, the system does NOT have live API access to Meta Ad Library, TikTok Creative Center, or Foreplay. Creative intelligence is derived from:

1. GPT-4o's training knowledge of advertising patterns by niche
2. DS-001's documented winning patterns and format effectiveness rules
3. User-provided context about their competitive landscape

This limitation MUST be stated in every strategy output:

```
NOTE: Creative research citations in V1 are derived from niche pattern knowledge
and DS-001 doctrine, not live competitor library data. For enhanced accuracy,
integrate Foreplay API in V2.
```

## 4. Ad Breakdown Template (DS-001 Section 6 — Verbatim)

When the system analyzes or references any ad (own or competitor):

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| Scene-by-scene breakdown | What happens in each segment |
| Hook analysis | What the first 3 seconds do and why |
| Buying triggers identified | Which psychological/emotional triggers are present |
| Visual proof elements | What visual evidence is shown and when |
| Credibility elements | Scientific claims, social proof, authority signals |
| Format classification | UGC, VSL, demo, comparison, testimonial, carousel, static |
| Hypothesized success drivers | Why this ad probably won (as testable hypotheses) |

---

## 5. V2 Integration Path (NOT BUILDING — Reference Only)

For V2 planning (NOT in scope for V1):
- Foreplay API integration for live swipe file access
- Meta Ad Library API for automated competitor monitoring
- Pattern database for cross-client learning accumulation
