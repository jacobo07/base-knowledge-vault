# VELOCITY LAW — TM-AdsOS

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Authority:** DS-001 Section 10, 12, 13 | CONSTITUTION.md v1.0
**Scope:** All scaling decisions, budget allocation, and dependency monitoring within TM-AdsOS and any TUAX Micro OS governing ad spend velocity.

## 1. Purpose

This law governs the velocity at which creative testing, iteration, and scaling may occur. It enforces DS-001's fundamental principle: Hit Rate Before Volume. No system may accelerate production or spend without meeting the readiness criteria defined here.

---

## 2. Scaling Readiness Gate (DS-001 Section 12 — Verbatim)

Scaling is BLOCKED unless ALL conditions are met:

| # | Condition | Threshold | Source |
|---|-----------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Hit rate | ≥ 10% (target ≥ 15%) | DS-001 Principle 1 |
| 2 | Learning loop active | Weekly creative meetings held for past 4 weeks | DS-001 Principle 7 |
| 3 | Whole Creative Document | Updated within past 7 days | DS-001 Section 6 |
| 4 | Winner understanding | 100% — every winner has "why it works" breakdown | DS-001 Principle 8 |
| 5 | Dependency concentration | Top 1 ad ≤ 30% of spend | DS-001 Section 10 |
| 6 | Iteration coverage | Every winner has ≥ 3 active iterations | DS-001 Principle 5 |
| 7 | Anti-pattern log | Updated within past 14 days | DS-001 Section 9 |
| 8 | Testing tracker | All launched concepts have hypothesis + learnings | DS-001 Principle 4 |

If ANY condition fails → Scaling is BLOCKED. The specific unmet condition is reported. No override permitted.

## 3. Dependency Concentration Alerts

| Metric | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold | Required Action |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Single ad % of total spend | > 30% | > 40% | Iteration sprint: 5+ variants within 7 days |
| Single ad sustained above critical | — | > 40% for 14+ days | BLOCK budget increases |
| Single angle % of winners | > 50% | > 70% | New angle testing initiative (minimum 2 new angles) |
| Single format % of winners | > 60% | > 80% | Format diversification testing (minimum 2 new formats) |
| Top 1 ad exceeds 60% | — | > 60% | ESCALATE to system owner immediately |

## 4. Budget Velocity Rules

### 4.1 — Test Budget Ceiling

```
max_weekly_test_budget = monthly_ad_budget × 0.25
```

No single week's testing may consume more than 25% of the monthly budget.

### 4.2 — Scale Budget Authorization

Budget increases beyond the current test level require:
1. All 8 scaling readiness conditions met
2. Minimum 2 consecutive profitable weeks
3. Budget increase ≤ 30% per week (no sudden jumps)

### 4.3 — Emergency Deceleration

If hit rate drops below 10% for 2 consecutive weeks:
1. BLOCK volume scaling
2. Reduce to minimum test budget
3. Return to research phase
4. Restart scaling readiness evaluation from scratch

---

## 5. Execution Cadence (DS-001 Section 11)

| Meeting | Frequency | Skip Tolerance |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Creative Strategy Meeting | Weekly | 0 — BLOCK new concepts after 2 missed weeks |
| Editor Alignment Meeting | Weekly | 0 — Quality degradation expected within 1 missed cycle |

The system outputs these cadence requirements in every strategy document as mandatory operational infrastructure.

---

## 6. Kill/Scale Thresholds (Per Session)

Generated by Agent 5 for each product:

| Threshold | Formula | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| kill_threshold_roas | breakeven_roas × 0.8 | Below this, the concept is unprofitable — kill after minimum test duration |
| scale_threshold_roas | operational_roas × 1.2 | Above this, the concept may receive increased budget |
| scale_threshold_hit_rate | 0.10 | System-wide minimum before any volume increase |

---

## 7. Immutability

This law may only be modified through a versioned commit with documented justification, evidence from 4+ weeks of production data, and system owner approval.
